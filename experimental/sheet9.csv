1|150|Apartment|Atlanta|Atlanta: Atlanta’s pro-business environment continues to attract companies and drive steady job growth within the metro. In 3Q'19, BlackRock announced that its new innovation center will bring >1k tech jobs to the Northeast submarket, beginning in ’20. Google expanded its presence in Midtown in 4Q'19 while Microsoft announced its new Atlanta office, which will bring ~1.5k jobs to Midtown, in 2Q’20. The Midtown submarket, offering a walkable lifestyle adjacent to Georgia Tech, has garnered significant attention from developers with ~2k apartment units under construction. While overall supply growth in Atlanta is in line with the top market average, the Gwinnet submarket has seen outsized development. Cumberland and Buckhead remain favorable due to their relatively muted supply pipelines and strong demographics; Buckhead continues to attract millennials with its walkability, strong transport systems, and cultural amenities while residents seeking suburban living flock to the Cumberland submarket, located only 20 minutes from Downtown. Traffic congestion and poor infrastructure are still problematic across the metro, although the city and state plan to invest $2.5B to improve MARTA lines and offerings over the next 25 years. With healthy employment growth and an increasing tech presence, Atlanta boasts a strong long-term outlook and near-term M-RevPAF growth that bests most top markets.|Labor shift towards a higher earning population aided by strong tech growth and reputable universities|Low tax rates will likely make Atlanta a destination for corporate relocations and working age population growth|Elevated supply barriers in Buckhead, Midtown and Cumberland, constraining future development|Market affordability is below comparable Sun Belt markets, hampering incremental demand |Poor household income in southern submarkets with less tech concentration will likely weigh down market effective rent|Traffic congestion and crime rating above Sun Belt average, negatively effecting household formation
1|151|Apartment|Austin|Austin: Strong asset value appreciation for Austin apartments has been driven by robust demand from both employment and population growth. Austin has become a major tech hub and destination for skilled, young workers that is fueled by a deep talent pool from local universities, a vibrant culture, and relative affordability. Upcoming expansion plans by brand-name employers bode well for job growth momentum. Apple’s $1 billion campus development  will bring 15k new jobs in the area by ’22. Facebook, Google, and Oracle, and now Tesla are also expanding their presence in the metro. This population boom has caused once-affordable home prices to surge, giving apartment owners more room to push rents. Rental demand anchored by the millennial cohort has been focused in the Downtown / Northwest submarkets, and the area around The Domain. New development has also been concentrated in these areas. The supply pipeline remains elevated, but demand is expected to allow for above-average M-RevPAF growth. Barriers to entry in Austin, while less than coastal markets, are the highest in Texas which will help support long-term rent growth. There is also growing evidence of NIMBYism in the area as residents and the city council have expressed concerns over increased traffic and rapidly rising home prices. Strong fundamentals, coupled with relatively attractive cap rates compared to markets with similar growth, drive attractive risk-adjusted returns.|Strong median household income fueled by an increasing share of tech employment growth from higher-cost hubs|An affordable market relative to other tech hubs with high paying employers |Population growth outpaces the average market in the top 50 due to no state income tax and a vibrant environment|Outdated infrastructure and inadequate public transportation to meet population growth  |High homeownership outside centrally located submarkets due to the affordable housing outside the city center|Very low supply barriers  allowing construction trends to meet excess demand
1|152|Apartment|Baltimore|The Baltimore market remains an intriguing option for investors shying away from the increasingly modest going-in yields presented by other East Coast markets. Fueled by growth in the information and professional services sectors, future economic growth in Baltimore is likely to outpace that of many of its Eastern seaboard peers. Notably, a strengthening high-tech sector largely comprised of cybersecurity firms continues to spill over from the neighboring D.C. Metro, bolstered by a highly skilled local workforce and the presence of major universities such as Johns Hopkins and the University of Maryland. Various suburbs intend to reap the benefits of this wave of cybersecurity growth; the Merriweather District development hopes to create a “center of gravity in the cyberspace community” while transforming the landscape of downtown Columbia. Such development is not limited to suburbs, however, as the massive Port Covington project seeks to breathe new life into Baltimore City. Despite such efforts over the long term, current headwinds include high crime rates and severely entrenched urban poverty, rendering Baltimore City a less attractive region in which to live and work. Higher cap rates may attract some yield-oriented investors, but poor intermediate-term growth and a fairly restrained long-term outlook should be a drag on returns. |Above-average Human Capital score illustrates well-educated renter base with strong median household incomes|Education and health care sectors provide stable, low-beta jobs with above-average pay |Higher affordability than adjacent D.C. metro attracts in-migration |High crime rates in Baltimore City, South, and East submarkets|Below-average mortgage-to-rent ratios and affordable homes encourage homeownership|Low relative CPPI appreciation in recent years; only average population growth estimates for the next five years
1|154|Apartment|Boston|Boston: The market continues to attract an outsized share of knowledge-based workers as employers are drawn to a well-educated population anchored by a top university system. Employers like Amazon, Foundation Medicine, Klaviyo, and Google are expanding in or relocating to Boston, bringing thousands of high-paying jobs to the metro. Millennial population continues to grow as recent graduates chase these high-paying jobs. In addition to in-migration, apartment demand is supported by some of the highest home prices across top markets, delaying homeownership for many renters. A healthy demand backdrop combined with an average supply pipeline will help the city overcome short-term struggles brought on by the pandemic, leaving Boston among the strongest gateway markets for intermediate growth potential. Healthy demand can be found in Boston’s downtown submarkets given a desirable lifestyle and proximity to work. Investors should be aware of the “Imagine Boston 2030” master plan and its aim to make the market more affordable by ‘30 through increased mixed-use development which will add apartment inventory to the metro. Solid long-term growth prospects, should provide investors with attractive risk-adjusted returns relative to most metros.|Renter demand is aided by a very expensive single-family market|Strong long-term growth prospects boost cap rates, leading to attractive long-term return expectations|Low crime rates and relatively walkable submarkets (e.g., Back Bay, Financial District, Fenway) buoy desirability|Growing rent control sentiment in legislative bodies (e.g., Bill H.3924 seeks to remove the prohibition of rent control)|“Imagine Boston 2030” aims to aid affordability; Suffolk Downs will add ~10k units over 20 years (~2% of stock)|Aging public transit system faces financial challenges
1|156|Apartment|New Jersey (Central)|New Jersey (Central): The Central New Jersey apartment market has proven a stable but low-growth market this past cycle. The long-term outlook remains underwhelming due to concerning fiscal health trends and sluggish employer growth. The state’s “Grow NJ” program, which provided tax incentives for companies that created or retained jobs in the region, had little success in Central New Jersey and finally expired in July ’19. The state’s concerning fiscal health (debt burden >$200B), which will likely be much worse following Covid-19, should deter investors as property tax increases to raise government funds would cut directly into the bottom line. Green Street estimates that a ~700 bp increase to the median resident’s non-federal tax burden is required to offset the state’s unfunded liabilities, which translates to an ~8% decline in after-tax income. Princeton University’s younger demographic provides steady rental demand for landlords in the Mercer / Princeton submarket, but the metro struggles to keep graduates from relocating to surrounding metros with better job prospects (e.g., New York, D.C., Boston). Stagnant population growth has pressured investors’ ability to push rents, and millennial out-migration forecasts will likely continue to weigh on long-term demand.|Growing life science industry provides steady demand near Princeton and New Brunswick|Expensive home prices delay homeownership for many renters|Muted supply pipeline supports above-average rent growth through the intermediate term|Concerning fiscal health issues in the state could lead to tax increases|Tepid population growth; outmigration of 25-34-year-old cohort|Struggles to attract high-quality jobs; loses out to nearby, larger metros
1|158|Apartment|Charlotte|Charlotte: Strong domestic in-migration and employment growth have provided nice tailwinds for apartment fundamentals. Young adults have flocked to North Carolina’s most populous metro, drawn by Charlotte’s diverse range of employment opportunities, relative affordability compared to other East Coast hubs, and a dynamic live / work / play environment. The quality of job growth has improved in recent years, fueled by the array of employers that operate in Charlotte and those that are choosing to expand in the market (e.g., Lowe’s, U.S. Bank, Honeywell). Developers have been active and there has been a focus on mixed-use development along the LYNX Blue Line metro, with a new delivery at seemingly every stop. In 4Q’19, Charlotte’s City Council voted to spend $50M for a transportation firm to design a 26-mile Silver Line light-rail connecting the East submarket to Uptown and westward into Gaston County, despite ongoing concerns about how the city will fund the ~$4B project. As competition for tenants increases, landlords have been forced to offer more amenitized space to differentiate their product. Supply growth across the metro is showing no signs of slowing, and though absorption has been healthy investors should remain cautious of the elevated supply pipeline over the next 5 years, especially if economic growth remains sluggish in the next few years. Demand in Midtown and Downtown should stack up favorably as young adults have demonstrated a strong propensity to rent in these submarkets. |Employment growth to significantly outperform top markets through favorable millennial population growth|Positive in-migration trends within the market aided by a strong financial sector, particularly within Midtown and CBD|Low personal income tax rates assisting millennial population growth and market desirability|Lagging infrastructure has led to unfavorable commute times in East Charlotte and Carmel|Above-average crime rating with poor Walk Score / accessibility serves as a demand headwind|Development expected to increase by ~13% of current stock through ’25, notably within Northeast Charlotte and Midtown
1|160|Apartment|Chicago|Chicago: The “Capital of the Midwest” exhibits stronger near-term apartment fundamentals than nearby Midwest markets, but Chicago still suffers from concerning long-term demographic and fiscal health trends. Owners are pressured by increasing tax liabilities from reassessed property values as the city / state try to alleviate fiscal woes. Additionally, a November ’20 ballot measure proposes graduated individual income tax rates between 4.95%-7.99%, changing from a current fixed rate of 4.95%. While increasing taxes hurts disposable income and has contributed to some out-migration, the modest silver lining is limited new supply in the market since developers are hesitant of the metro’s higher taxes and rising construction costs. Investors should be aware of the $6B Lincoln Yards master plan, which will phase in ~6k apartment units to the Lincoln Park / Old Town submarket over the intermediate term. In addition to fiscal issues, the metro suffers from millennial out-migration and unattractive employment trends, losing share to markets with higher-paying job opportunities. The wealthy population that resides in the Glencoe / Wilmette submarket, which falls outside of city limits (and thus outside of Chicago’s fiscal issues), pay some of the highest nominal rents across the market. Landlords have been able to consistently push rent in this submarket despite overall metro headwinds.|Higher cost of living delays homebuying for many renters|Expansive public transit system allows easy access to amenities|A strong university system has the potential to support higher paying jobs in the metro|Lincoln Yards development to phase ~6k apartment units to Lincoln Park / Old Town submarket by ’23|Out-migration of renting age cohorts; Covid driving renters out of denser, urban areas into suburban markets|Rising tax environment from poor city / state finances is a deterrent to entering the market
1|161|Apartment|Cincinnati|Cincinnati: Cincinnati’s growth is broadly driven by its exposure to a few large corporate headquarters, including Kroger, Proctor & Gamble, and Macy’s. While large companies have helped propel job growth this last cycle, primarily in the finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE) sectors, a troubled manufacturing industry and lackluster population growth will likely weigh on apartment demand. Proximity to Columbus’ more stable job market hurts Cincinnati’s ability to attract young talent and prevent millennials from migrating. Very affordable single-family housing has also resulted in one of the highest homeownership rates relative to the top markets, which limits an investor’s ability to push apartment rents. One positive for the metro is Proctor and Gamble’s and Kroger’s strong quarterly earnings and forward-guidance in late ‘19, both of whom were facing challenges over the past few years. Despite an encouraging trajectory early in the year for P&G and Kroger, Covid-19 has disrupted future hiring plans for two of Cincinnati’s largest employers. In addition, Macy’s plans to slash ~3,900 corporate and management jobs as part of a restructuring plan will likely further dampen apartment fundamentals. Limited demand tailwinds, affordable homes, underwhelming demographics, and lagging population growth restrict the metro’s long-term NOI growth potential.	|Lower non-farm job loss percentage compared to its Midwest peers during ‘20|Six Fortune 500 corporate headquarters bring stability to the local economy|Increased demand in the Central submarket stemming from Clifton Heights neighborhood revitalization|Slowing population growth of the 25-34 age cohort due to competition from other Ohio markets|Low supply barriers diminish pricing power as supply matches demand|Low mortgage-to-rent ratio due to the affordable home prices in the metro
1|162|Apartment|Cleveland|Cleveland: A lack of young talent and weak job growth point to a continuation of poor apartment fundamentals. Once a manufacturing powerhouse, Cleveland has failed to redefine itself as globalization and technological innovation continue to leave many Rust Belt cities behind. The city suffers from significant out-migration, which is expected to continue over the next 5 years led by a decline in young adults who are relocating for better opportunities. Cleveland’s lone bright spot and best hope for reversing momentum remains in health care. The Case Western Reserve University Medical School and the Cleveland Clinic are large providers of high-paying jobs and economic activity. Investments in the life sciences is underway at the Cleveland Clinic’s research centers that may help generate some growth. However, it remains doubtful that the health care sector’s job growth in isolation will be able to resuscitate the local economy.  The Downtown submarket is demonstrating emerging strength due to a modernization effort by the Downtown Cleveland Alliance to create an innovation district. Despite development initiatives to generate an increasingly vibrant downtown area, Cleveland still struggles to compete with more desirable Midwest markets.	|Exposure to the strong and low beta health care sector provides economic stability|Higher current effective rents in the University Circle submarket as a result of stronger demographics|Recent redevelopment efforts attempt to revitalize the CBD|Affordable housing leads to above-average homeownership rates that limit apartment demand|Expected out-migration through ’25 of the 25-34 age cohort reduces potential renter demand|Recent out-migration of high paying jobs coupled with exposure to manufacturing
1|166|Apartment|Dallas|Dallas: Dallas continues to be an attractive destination for businesses and employees. Companies are drawn to the region because of the business-friendly environment, affordability, and centralized location. This trend is best exemplified by Core-Mark (CORE) making the decision to move from San Francisco to Dallas in 1Q’19, citing cost savings and Dallas’s strategic location as key drivers. In addition to diverse job opportunities, residents are also attracted to the area’s affordability and lifestyle. The spread between mortgage payments and rent continues to widen as home price appreciation outpaces rent growth. This trend could be a major tailwind for apartment demand since single-family affordability has restrained M-RevPAF growth in the area historically. Another factor impeding M-RevPAF growth is an overabundance of supply that is fueled by pro-development policies and low-barriers to entry across the market. Currently, Dallas has one of the largest supply pipelines in the country, with a bulk of the new supply focused in the northern neighborhoods of Plano / Frisco. Elevated supply should cause M-RevPAF growth to lag the top market average in the intermediate term, despite a strong demand outlook.|Low cost of living|Diverse economy|Strong Fortune 500 presence|Affordable single-family housing|Low barriers to entry|Stagnant employment momentum
1|168|Apartment|Denver|Denver: Denver continues to attract jobs from a diverse set of employment bases. YoY TAMI job growth  has been trending at an average of ~4% each month since the beginning of ’19. TAMI growth is supported by the in-migration of several startups and small tech firms, along with tech giants such as Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, and Apple. High-quality job opportunities, coupled with Denver’s desirable quality of life and access to nature, have attracted many young residents, making “The Mile-High City” a hot spot for millennial migration. Millennial demand has skyrocketed in trendy neighborhoods such as the LoHi / Highlands neighborhood in the Golden / Wheatridge submarket, and the RiNo Arts District in the Northeast submarket. Demand in the Downtown submarket is bolstered by the walkable, urban environment. Continued interest from affluent, highly-compensated millennials in these submarkets should allow for strong rent growth potential. The market’s low initial investment yields are offset by solid long-term growth, driving above-average risk-adjusted returns.|High competition for homeownership increases rental demand, notably in the downtown and Central submarkets|Millennials attracted to trendy LoDo and RiNo areas surrounding Downtown submarket|Increasing high income job growth driven by the TAMI sector |Heavy new development concentrated in Central and Downtown submarket; supply growth of ~2.0% in '21|Significant cap rate compression over last decade leads to average long-term return expectations|Bottom tier K-12 school ratings; decreases attractiveness for families choosing between comparable markets 
1|169|Apartment|Detroit|Detroit: Optimism in the “Motor City” is fading as employment figures weaken and investment in the market is failing to provide substantial and sustainable improvement. Economic growth is expected to lag the rest of the Midwest through the intermediate term, even with substantial investments from billionaire Dan Gilbert and national automotive companies. The metro is hindered by continued dependence on stagnating industries and fails to make a meaningful economic shift toward higher-growth industries. TAMI jobs have seen consistent net outflow for years, and overall employment growth in Detroit ranks among the lowest across top markets (~35% of the population lives below the poverty line). The lack of well-paying jobs hampers in-migration as new graduates and millennials choose more desirable markets that offer better compensation to start their careers. Tepid demand from minimal population and job growth mixed with low supply barriers provide a weak intermediate-term outlook for the apartment sector. Additionally, rising construction costs are leading developers to rethink their plans or ditch them all together as rents cannot keep up with increasing development costs. This is exemplified in projects like the East Jefferson Meijer, originally planned as a 213-unit mixed-use apartment / small-format grocer development that was abandoned in favor of a larger-format grocery store and parking lot. While the market has improved substantially since its bankruptcy in ‘13, the outlook still looks bleak.|Growing research and development initiatives by automotive companies supports robust  income growth|Minimal projected supply growth will likely put less pressure on stabilized assets and may offer rent growth upside|Spillover effect from University of Michigan students might help boost fundamentals in the Ann Arbor submarket|One of the highest unemployment rates, notably in the Midtown, Dearborn Downriver, and Downtown submarkets|Low cost-of-living drives a high homeownership rate that will weigh on apartment fundamentals|Struggles to attract millennial talent due to poor weather, limited walkability, and limited employment opportunities
1|170|Apartment|District of Columbia|District of Columbia: D.C. apartment fundamentals have remained steady thanks to decent business / professional services job growth, which has offset the stagnating government, finance, and information sectors. The metro has also seen increased hiring in the stable education and health services sectors. Several revitalization projects are currently underway that will reshape the metro, including Phase I of The Wharf, an urban renewal of D.C.’s southwest waterfront that opened in ’17. Phase II will bring an additional 1.15M SF of mixed-use development, slated to deliver by ’22. In November ‘18, Amazon announced that it will officially split its coveted HQ2 location between Crystal City, VA and Long Island City, NY, with each region gaining ~25K jobs. The announcement, which capitivated the attention of institutional investors, is widely viewed as a win for D.C. apartment operators who stand to benefit from an influx of highly-compensated employees.  While the metro’s affluent demographics and high cost of homeownership will continue to support apartment fundamentals, D.C. is also facing millennial out-migration. Strong millennial demand for rentals originally fueled D.C.’s apartment frenzy, but since ’15, out-migration has outpaced in-migration, which is a trend that is expected to persist and will serve as a future demand headwind for operators.|Better than average per capita income levels|Strong local universities|High cost of homeownership promotes renting|Millennial out-migration reduces demand|Recent volatility of government budgets / jobs|Competition from surrounding suburbs
1|171|Apartment|Fairfield County|Fairfield County: Statewide fiscal concerns and tepid job growth continue to suppress apartment fundamentals in Fairfield County. Outsized municipal debt and unfunded liabilities have forced higher tax rates, a major determinant for several corporate HQ departures over the past few years (e.g., GE to Boston, Starwood to Miami). Fairfield County has not been able to attract any large relocations to backfill those gaps left behind. Meanwhile, the metro continues to face the headwinds of a shift from active to passive investment management, though FIRE employment improved in '18 after 22 consecutive months of YoY job declines. The market serves as a suburban living alternative to Manhattan which attracts more families looking to live in homes than rent apartments. Millennial population growth continues to decelerate as more prefer to live closer to Manhattan-based jobs.  While limited new construction will support apartment rent growth, unfavorable demographics and fiscal health issues should handcuff long-term NOI growth.|Favorable demographics; abundance of high earners|Limited existing and new supply|Reacceleration in FIRE employment|Unfriendly business environment; high taxes|Inability to attract any large corporate moves|Fiscal health concerning
1|172|Apartment|Fort Lauderdale|Fort Lauderdale: Moderate job and population growth paired with middle-of-the-pack supply growth create a mixed outlook for Fort Lauderdale apartments. While tourism has historically been the primary economic growth driver, Fort Lauderdale’s economy is diversifying with a promising life sciences sector and steady job growth in the FIRE and professional / business services industries. The Fort Lauderdale, Plantation, and Miramar / Pembroke Pines submarkets have seen the most supply as developers seek opportunity north of Miami. Las Olas Boulevard in the Fort Lauderdale submarket has attracted significant development due to its walkable lifestyle and downtown feel. Las Olas Walk, a mixed-use development, will add ~1,200 luxury rental units to the submarket by late '20. For favorable demographics and a limited supply pipeline, investors should look to the Davie submarket, which boasts the wealthiest and most educated residents in the metro.  While Fort Lauderdale’s coastal location and steady job growth support a healthy rent profile, the market’s outlook is moderated by condo oversupply in the near term and a lack of meaningful supply barriers over the long term. |Desirable market that continues to attract millennials migrating along the coast|Population growth benefits from nearby Miami’s growth and the metro’s affordability relative to Miami|Davie submarket benefits from favorable demographics and a limited supply pipeline|Hurricanes increase cap-ex burden and insurance costs|Slowdown in influx of foreign capital and visitors likely to persist through Covid-19 pandemic |Notable development in Fort Lauderdale with >5.3k units under construction in ’20 
1|177|Apartment|Houston|Houston: After being impacted heavily by the energy bust in ’15, Houston’s economy is still recovering. A silver lining of the energy recession is a slightly more diversified economy; the health care sector has seen growth, exemplified by Texas Medical Center becoming the world’s largest medical complex. Petrochemical manufacturing and other downstream energy activities have also experienced outsized growth. Although Houston has diversified its economy in recent years, the 1Q’20 collapse in oil prices and Covid-19 pandemic have presented additional challenges for the market. A large amount of supply was delivered directly into the energy recession and is still being absorbed by the market, as evidenced by below-average occupancy rates. Now, given the current uncertain economic environment, the already-present vacancy rate troubles will likely be prolonged. The current supply pipeline, while not massive, is large enough to continue to put downward pressure on intermediate-term M-RevPAF growth. A lack of zoning laws and a sprawling metroplex provide little regulatory or physical barriers to entry, suppressing long-term growth. Investors should look west towards the Montrose / River Oaks and Museum submarkets where there are higher incomes, more expensive housing, and elevated rents, but in aggregate expect below-average long-term returns, as higher going in yields are offset by lackluster long-term NOI growth potential.|Houston’s low cost of living makes it a top candidate for in-migration and WFH relocators|One of the highest concentrations of Fortune 500 companies in the nation due to a favorable tax environment|Infrastructure improvements such as the NHHIP will expand freeways and improve poor commute times|Low supply barriers due to quick approval timelines, limited infrastructure constraints, and limited density restrictions|Nearly half of jobs (nine sectors – retail, food service, etc.) are sensitive to social distancing guidelines|Substantial economic exposure to the struggling energy sector
1|178|Apartment|Indianapolis|Indianapolis: The capital of the “Hoosier State” has little to offer apartment investors in terms of long-term rent growth, as structural headwinds stemming from poor demographics and minimal supply constraints create a challenging environment. The job growth occurring is largely seen in the warehouse and manufacturing sectors which, combined with an outflow of high-paying TAMI jobs, limits income growth potential. While a quicker Covid-19 recovery is expected in Indianapolis over the next few years, the market should revert to below-average long-term growth relative to other top markets. Rent growth is constrained by affordable homeownership options available throughout the metro, and despite low regulatory and physical barriers, supply growth screens below average. Most of the development occurring in the metro can be found in the Downtown and Southwest submarkets. Meanwhile, the surrounding suburban submarkets exhibit the highest median incomes in the metro and have had more success in attracting investors (e.g., Spruce Capital, who purchased a ~1k unit suburban portfolio in early ’20). Though strong intermediate-term growth and high going-in yields screen attractive on the surface, affordable home prices allow renters to quickly transition into homeowners, hurting long-term rent growth potential.|Above-average population growth over the intermediate term relative to other Midwest markets |Favorable demographic trends in the Downtown submarket |Low employment losses in ‘20 provides stability in downturns like the Covid-19 induced recession |High homeownership rate due to affordable homes limits apartment demand |Weak relative long-term rent growth potential in the East submarket |Low return expectations due to a lack of growth in high paying industries such as TAMI 
1|179|Apartment|Jacksonville|Jacksonville: While healthy population and job growth bode well for apartment demand in Jacksonville, supply growth concerns weigh heavily on long-term rent growth potential. The Southside submarket is seeing the bulk of oncoming supply as it has both cheap land for development and is home to a younger and more educated population. The Arlington and Downtown submarkets are also seeing significant supply growth, particularly as the city and developers try to revitalize downtown to attract and retain more residents.  Notable developments include the District, a $600M mixed-use development on the Southbank that will add ~1k residential units, a hotel, and a marina to the metro. Near the Southbank, San Marco is seeing substantial development with ~800 units to be added by '21. Investors should look to the Beaches submarket, which benefits from the market’s highest rents and limited supply along the coast. Strong population and employment growth will help Jacksonville weather the upcoming recession reasonably well, leading to above-average near-term M-RevPAF growth; however, the lack of any meaningful barriers to supply outside of the coast restrains long-term rent growth potential.   |Diversified labor force through FIRE / industrial sector kept nonfarm employment fundamentals relatively strong in ’20|Favorable business / living cost environment serves as a long-term catalyst for in-migration|School ratings in the metro, predominantly along The Beaches submarket should draw residents|Affordable single-family rental inventory outside of The Beaches puts pressure on multifamily demand|Population density is considerably below comparable Sun Belt metros|Large development pipeline with Baymeadows alone expected to deliver ~1,100 units (7.5% of stock) through ‘23
1|180|Apartment|Kansas City|Kansas City: A shallower trough in Covid-induced job losses versus most markets and solid expected intermediate growth are bright spots for Kansas City, but the metro’s longer-term return prospects continue to be hampered by structural headwinds. While the market’s supply pipeline remains below-average, new units will likely struggle to be absorbed in the face of subpar income and population growth. Employers such as the USDA and CarMax have chosen to establish new operations within the market, attracted by low costs of living and doing business. Existing companies such as Cerner, Garmin, and Burns McDonnel have all announced that they are expanding their footprint in the metro with plans to add over 18k combined jobs in the next few years (~3% expansion of the existing non-farm workforce). While hiring by these companies and efforts to improve local transportation infrastructure may help the metro recover from the Covid-19 fallout more quickly over the intermediate term, the metro’s continued inability to draw high-paying employers results in unfavorable long-term growth, driving below-average risk-adjusted returns.|High going-in yields and strong M-RevPAF growth lead to attractive areas, notably Overland Park North|Resilient and diversified economy makes it a low beta market|Low cost of living continues to lead to in-migration|Very low barriers to homeownership due to the low cost of homes in the metro|Low barriers to supply; supply growth of ~3.4% in ‘21 |The market lacks high income earners and employment growth will under perform relative to other Sun Belt markets
1|182|Apartment|Las Vegas|Las Vegas: Above-average job growth has bolstered Las Vegas apartment fundamentals in recent years, but this trend has dramatically reversed with Covid-19’s outsized hit on the hospitality and leisure industries. The market now faces all-time high levels of unemployment, among the worst of the top markets. The economy’s heavy reliance on the tourism and hospitality industries has proven to be an extreme risk, and its health will greatly depend on the future progression of the virus and the availability of a vaccine. Though jobs are expected to return in the future, and the Allegiant Stadium completion is expected to create ~1.2k new jobs, apartment demand will continue to face long-term fundamental headwinds created by a cheap single-family market that incentivizes homeownership and lower-paying job growth. As residents continue to migrate from California, many immediately look at investing in a home as housing prices are very affordable relative to the high-cost, West Coast markets. A strong focus on single family development has kept apartment supply in check, a positive for owners, but very low going-in yields combined with an uncertain path of recovery over the long-term limit investors’ return potential.|Being previously redlined as a housing bust market, supply has not caught up with the increased demand|Millennial population growth has been among the highest of the top markets since ’15; this trend should continue|No personal state income tax boosts the market’s desirability to both employers and employees|The affordability of homes and availability of single-family rentals limits apartment demand|Job growth is concentrated in low-paying industries; TAMI and FIRE job growth has failed to gain momentum|Low going-in yields and muted long-term growth prospects limit investor return potential
1|185|Apartment|Long Island|Long Island: After underwhelming job growth through much of the recent upcycle, Long Island’s local economy was one of the worst performers among the top  markets following the onset of the recession. The health care and education sectors, which have historically been a bright spot for job growth, experienced net declines throughout 1H’20, though the metro’s large government sector (~15% of jobs) held up relatively well. Long Island’s apartment demand generally benefits from New York City spillover, but this effect may be limited in the near term as the city grapples with economic fallout from the pandemic. It remains to be seen if tech growth in NYC will continue at its recent pace given the city’s fiscal issues and the acceleration in working from home, but already-announced expansions in ’19 (e.g., Google, Facebook, and Amazon) will provide incremental apartment demand. However, this will largely be confined to NYC’s urban core and Long Island submarkets in close proximity to Manhattan (i.e., Hempstead). Nearly 30% of Long Island’s population is between the ages of 45-64, among the highest across the top markets. As such, the region will likely never be a top destination for apartment investors due to its older, homeowning demographic, but a light supply pipeline should mitigate the job loss impact on rent growth to an extent.|Expensive cost of living and high home prices delays homebuying for many renters|Light supply pipeline allows owners to push rents from an already high absolute base|Some renter relocation from NYC as urban exodus boosts suburban market demand|~45% of the population is 45 years or older; less likely to rent|Tepid job growth through recent upcycle – lack of high growth industries|High homeownership rates as market caters itself to single-family homeowners who vacation from / commute to NYC
1|186|Apartment|Los Angeles|Los Angeles: The LA apartment market is comprised of many cities across a vast geographic area and contains some of the highest barrier-to-entry submarkets in the nation (e.g., Santa Monica, Malibu Hills). Demand for housing in LA continues to exceed available supply, putting pressure on renters in a high-barrier, landlord-favored market. In 2H’19, AB 1482 was enacted by Governor Newsom implementing statewide rent control for renewal offers on apartments older than 15 years. The law will be in effect from January ’20 until January ‘30. Additionally, Prop 21, a measure to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, will appear on the November ’20 ballot (a similar ballot measure failed in ’18), reigniting concern amongst landlords that local governments may be able to enact more restrictive forms of rent control. Prospective investors should look west of the I-405 freeway, known as the Westside, for the strongest long-term rent growth potential as these highly desirable and supply-constrained submarkets are supported by healthy demographics and solid high-paying job growth. Los Angeles is one of the most highly regulated markets in the U.S., as geographical barriers, NIMBYism, and elevated construction costs keep supply in check. Tight supply dynamics and robust demand will continue to contribute to strong long-term NOI growth for the market.|Residents are often forced to rent due to high tax rates and elevated mortgage-to-rent ratio|Malibu Hills, El Segundo, and Beverly Hills submarkets offer some of the strongest LT rent growth potential in the U.S. |Diverse labor force supported by quality local universities allow for above average income growth|Mediocre public transit infrastructure leads to heavy traffic congestion|Unfriendly business environment leading employers like CBRE to move headquarters out of the market|Unfriendly towards apartment landlords evidenced by eviction moratoriums and high bad debt rates among renters in '20
1|187|Apartment|Louisville|Louisville: With a regional focus and high employment concentration in manufacturing and other traditionally low-growth industries, Louisville’s economic prospects remain muted as compared with its Midwest peers. Some job growth has occurred in the metro, but mainly in the low-wage manufacturing and wholesale sectors; employment growth in the higher-paying TAMI and FIRE industries has been virtually nonexistent. A lack of demand stemming from minimal job growth is exacerbated by the metro’s relatively less desirable lifestyle, evident by minimal millennial population inflow. Demand headwinds and lack of  supply barriers limit a landlord’s ability to push rent. Additionally, the market’s low cost of living  drives homeownership relative to other metros, further hindering long-term rent growth. Like much of the Midwest, high going-in yields appear attractive, but there is little upside as the metro’s underwhelming outlook over the intermediate and long term limit return expectations.|Several large health care companies with a sizeable presence aids job creation|Stable cash flow stream with less volatility compared to high beta metros|Growing logistics industry may help improve GDP growth|Above-average projected supply growth will likely put additional pressure on rent growth potential|Low cost-of-living and a high homeownership rate will hinder apartment fundamentals in near-and long-term|The poor weather and high levels of crime relative to the top markets makes it difficult to attract millennial talent
1|188|Apartment|Memphis|Memphis: The Memphis economy continues to miss out on the wave of growth in the technology and professional services industries that has propelled other southern metros. Concentrated in the trade and manufacturing sectors, Memphis’s undiversified and stagnant economy establishes a low ceiling on rent growth as high-paying jobs are few and far between. One of the few strengths of the markets lies in its low cash flow volatility, bolstered in part by a handful of Fortune 500 HQs. As the economy continues to find its footing amidst an on-going recession, Memphis’s low tech exposure contributes to a near-term M-RevPAF growth prospect that is expected to slightly outperform our top market average. TAMI and FIRE employment bases in Memphis are small and growing at a meager pace. Demographics in the ‘Home of Blues’ also bode poorly, as population growth significantly lags that of other southern metros and low-to-middle income households comprise a larger share of the market than the national average. Poor market fundamentals and struggling demographics, compounded by an active supply pipeline, present headwinds that render Memphis’ return profile among the least attractive in the country.|Manufacturing and logistics industries stabilize employment volatility|Lower cost of living than nearby markets; and the favorable tax environment may help in-migration trends from WFH|Favorable incentives offered to businesses to operate in Memphis (e.g., tax, training, utility, and financing)|Lack of educated workforce limits income growth potential|Home prices rank very affordable compared to top markets|Outside of the Midtown submarket, population density is below the top markets average
1|189|Apartment|Miami|Miami: Miami’s business-friendly environment and cultural amenities support healthy demographics and long-term apartment fundamentals. Since '13, Miami has seen domestic out-migration, largely to other Florida metros, as some residents are priced out of the growing city; however, international immigrants and high-earners seeking low taxes have driven steady per-capita income growth (average income of a person moving to Miami has exceeded those leaving). Miami’s low-tax environment has also attracted a growing tech / finance presence and solid job growth in the metro. Elevated supply, largely in the Downtown, Opa-Locka, and Miami Beach submarkets, remains a concern but is outweighed by strong demand growth, resulting in a healthy near-term M-RevPAF growth forecast. In the Downtown submarket, the trendy Wynwood and the Design District neighborhoods are seeing notable supply in response to their popularity with millennials, while Little Haiti has been pegged as the next neighborhood to gentrify. Investors should also take note of Miami Worldcenter, a mixed-use project that will add ~1.9k new apartment units to the Downtown submarket by '21. Brickell remains a favorite submarket for its central location and strong demographics while Coral Gables stands out for its minimal supply pipeline. As a desirable metro with favorable demographics, Miami’s long-term rent growth potential for apartments is among the best of our top markets. 	|Brickell and Coral Gables remain favorite submarkets for central location and strong demographics|Continued growth of the financial industry; Goldman Sachs considering moving its asset management division to Miami|Atlantic Ocean and Everglades act as long-term supply barriers	|Job growth concentrated in low-wage industries	|Flooding is an increasingly relevant issue; Projected $4B-$8B cost over 10 years to stormproof Miami |Miami Worldcenter, a mixed-use project, will add ~1.9k new apartment units to the Downtown submarket by '21
1|191|Apartment|Minneapolis|Minneapolis: Despite a number of large, stable employers, a full construction pipeline is weighing on Minneapolis’ intermediate rent growth outlook. Long-term advantages for the market include an outsized presence of S&P 500 companies and an educated labor force from nearby universities. However, local health care employment growth decelerated meaningfully throughout ’19 and bears watching moving forward. Local housing policy changes are further complicating the picture for apartment investors; Minneapolis’ “2040 Comprehensive Plan” upzones the majority of the city and effectively decreases supply barriers for much of the market. Furthermore, inclusionary zoning efforts are currently underway, intending to mandate that a portion of newly developed units be set aside as affordable housing. Currently, an interim plan is in place with the intention of more robust legislation being enacted. Elevated new supply and tepid employment growth over the coming years result in below-average market rent growth and weak long-term growth estimates.|Highly educated population base and presence of large nearby universities helps attract employers to the region|The Downtown submarket will benefit from Deluxe Corp moving its headquarters from Shoreview, bringing >500 jobs|Prominence of large professional services firms continues to support high-paying jobs, leading to above-average HHI|One of the relatively highest homeownership rates will weigh heavily on apartment fundamentals in near-and long-term|Heavy supply growth and inclusionary zoning efforts puts a damper on long-term rent growth potential|Poor Desirability Index, a relatively isolated location, and severe climate
1|192|Apartment|Nashville|Nashville: Nashville’s educated workforce, relative affordability, and significant population growth have attracted large companies to the metro. Alliance Bernstein is relocating its global headquarters, which will bring ~1,050 jobs to Nashville, and Amazon plans to bring another ~5,000 jobs to its new downtown operations hub, both of whom began hiring in '19 and will continue to hire through '24. The meaningful job growth over the past couple years has been a positive tailwind for apartment fundamentals. As rents climbed over the past several years during this local economic boom, regulators have altered zoning laws that allow for more developments in the urban core, leading to increased supply. The meaningful new supply is driving below-average M-RevPAF growth expectations despite significant in-migration and job growth. Nashville also benefits from a leading health care industry; 17 publicly traded health care companies are headquartered in the city, which supports high-paying jobs and economic stability. One caution facing apartment demand is the high homeownership rate outside of the Downtown and Airport submarkets.  While a healthy supply pipeline and high homeownership rate pose some threats to apartment fundamentals, the stable health care industry and significant population growth provides investors with solid long-term growth potential.|High millennial growth attracted to cultural amenities and relatively affordable cost of living|Diverse economy across various sectors, resulting in low economic risk|Tech and healthcare sectors driving relatively high income in the region|Supply growth among the highest in the US; Capitol View development will deliver 600 units in DT submarket|Lower barriers to homeownership because of more affordable home prices; decreased propensity to rent|Meaningful population density only exists in the Downtown submarket; the rest of the market screens more suburban 
1|195|Apartment|New York|New York: As the epicenter of the U.S. pandemic, New York faced steep job losses and deteriorating apartment fundamentals in the first half of ‘20. Finance remains the backbone of New York’s economy, and though not immune from layoffs, fared better than most industries in 1H’20. Growing tech interest in the city of late is a bright spot for apartment demand, with Facebook, Google, and Amazon all announcing large-scale expansions in ’19 (>20k jobs collectively). However, it remains to be seen if tech companies will modify pre-COVID plans following the acceleration in working from home. NYC would be a relative loser to lower-cost metros in a world where remote working becomes widely adopted. New York’s budget deficits worsened following the pandemic, and now require an estimated  ~600 bps increase to the median renter’s tax burden to cover the shortfall, which could accelerate recent outmigration. Asking rents fell precipitously in 1H’20 (~-10% YoY) and leasing activity was accompanied by a notable rise in concessions (~50% of new leases included concessions as of June ‘20). Just as investors began to wrap their heads around the expansive rent control laws passed in June ’19 by the state, transaction markets froze in 2Q’20 due to uncertainty surrounding asset prices, which have likely fallen double-digits.. A favorable supply outlook remains a silver lining for NYC, but apartment investors face significant headwinds in the coming years and a less-favorable long-term outlook in a post-COVID world. |Business capital of the U.S. – employees in the market maintain above-average incomes and strong income growth|High cost of living and home prices bolsters rental demand|Soft supply forecast as deliveries show signs of slowing through the intermediate term|High beta market – among largest decline in asset values across top markets during pandemic recession|Out-migration of renting age cohorts through the intermediate term|Anti-business policy risk (e.g., rent control, greater taxation)
1|196|Apartment|Norfolk / Hampton Roads|Norfolk/Hampton Roads: The Norfolk / Hampton Roads market has experienced instability in recent years as the region’s reliance upon shipbuilding and government sector employment has taken a sizeable hit due to fiscal budget volatility and waning demand for shipbuilding. It is still unclear whether trade conflict with China will escalate and adversely affect market fundamentals. Steady growth in professional and business services has helped offset declines in government employment. Norfolk has the unique benefit of being a military town, as many military service members provide a foundation for the renter population. Local politicians have noted the need for increased retention of young adults to boost the regional economy and have spearheaded several initiatives to increase its cultural appeal. The efforts haven’t resulted in any major relocations, but the development of Ferguson’s new 8-story corporate HQ in Newport News, which was heavily subsidized by the city, provides anecdotal evidence that the government is ready and willing to sponsor local businesses. Retention of young adults will be critical to both the Norfolk / Hampton Roads economy as well as for renter demand. |Moderate income growth expectations|Affordable cost of living / business|Local gov willing to provide tax grants to attract employers|Sizeable losses in government sector|Weak population growth projections|Competition from nearby metros
1|197|Apartment|New Jersey (Northern)|New Jersey (Northern): Outsized job losses and subpar population growth pressure apartment fundamentals in Northern New Jersey. The metro serves as a cheaper alternative to Manhattan, especially in the urban Hudson County, but spillover demand from NYC has yet to translate into strong M-RevPAF growth. Several submarkets, including Hoboken and Jersey City, may begin to benefit from proximity to high-paying job growth across the river in Hudson Yards. The rise in work from home may accelerate this phenomenon, but it remains to be seen whether renters would rather flee NYC’s urban core for the cheaper NJ region, or instead opt to leave the NY-NJ area altogether given New Jersey’s dire fiscal health profile (~700bp tax increase required to cover the state’s unfunded liabilities). Future job forecasts remain underwhelming, but M-RevPAF growth should prove less sensitive to the economy in the near term. The expiration of the “Grow NJ” tax incentive program in ’19 dealt another blow to the region as the state has yet to find a replacement despite its moderate success in attracting relocations to the northern part of the state. Without tax incentives, Northern New Jersey will likely continue to shed jobs to more affordable metros, as companies are enticed by lower costs of business and faster-growing labor pools. Rent growth has lagged the top markets following elevated deliveries in ’17 and ’18, but the current supply pipeline should allow fundamentals to play catch-up in the intermediate term, resulting in a modest return profile.|More affordable alternative to NYC with multi-modal commuter transportation to Manhattan|Life science growth brings higher incomes to NJN; Morris submarket seeing largest concentration of life science jobs|Above-average expected returns; attractive for investors looking to deploy capital in NYC region|Weak intermediate employment forecasts should result in slower economic recovery|Poor fiscal health – increasing tax environment likely|Tepid population growth as NYC migrants may choose to leave the region entirely for more desirable markets
1|198|Apartment|Oakland-East Bay|Oakland-East Bay: While the East Bay has often been overlooked by institutional capital in past cycles, exceptionally low cap rates and softening fundamentals in neighboring Bay Area markets could shift additional interest to the relatively higher going-in yields in Oakland. Though still in the early innings, if the current work from home trend continues to accelerate, Oakland could be a relative winner as renters seek cheaper alternatives to San Francisco and Silicon Valley. Near-term growth forecasts reflect slightly stronger performance relative to its Bay Area peers as a result of these developing trends. Employer interest in Oakland has grown in recent years with multiple companies (e.g., Facebook and Microsoft) expressing interest in the area, a trend that should contribute to healthy population growth. In late ’19,  Facebook announced plans to increase their footprint in the market to upwards of ~1.3M SF of office space, which appears to be moving forward as planned. Increasingly strict California regulations and NIMBYism throughout the market keep the development pipeline lower than average. The Downtown submarket, however, should continue to see elevated deliveries in the near and intermediate term as a result of its proximity to public transit and its walkability, making it an appealing location for young renters and employees commuting into San Francisco. Though going-in yields remain low, healthy intermediate- and long-term NOI growth contribute to returns that rank among the top of the pack.  |Strong demographics; affluent and well-educated population base driven by proximity to high-quality universities  |Expected to be among the top performers over the long term due to strong demographics|Higher going-in yields relative to Bay Area peers|Risk-adjusted returns expected to lag top market average|West Contra Costa and Downtown / Alameda submarkets burdened by high crime rates and weak school systems|Future rent control legislation risk persists as progressive ballot measures continue to arise locally and at the state level 
1|201|Apartment|Orange County|Orange County: Healthy income growth and limited development have been the key drivers of Orange County’s improving apartment fundamentals in recent years. Job growth in Orange County has been mediocre of late, but the region enjoys a diversified workforce led by notable companies like Walt Disney, Boeing, and The Irvine Company. Because of the market’s housing costs, which are amongst the highest in the nation, residents are often forced to rent, creating a tailwind for apartment demand. California recently enacted a series of bills intended to address the state’s affordability issues, which may make it incrementally easier to develop apartments; however, multifamily permitting activity growth has consistently slowed over the last 3 years. In 2H’19, AB 1482 was enacted by Governor Newsom implementing statewide rent control for renewal offers on apartments that are older than 15 years. The law will be in effect beginning in January ’20 until January ‘30. Additionally, Prop 21, a measure to amend the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, will appear on the November ’20 ballot (a similar ballot measure failed in ’18), reigniting fear amongst landlords that local governments may be able to enact more restrictive forms of rent control. Investors should also be cognizant of The Irvine Company, which controls much of the region’s inventory and often influences market rents.|	High home prices and mortgage costs make renting more appealing / a necessity for many|	Strong submarkets (e.g., Newport Beach, Irvine) with low crime rates and high school ratings|	Diverse, highly educated labor force fueled by quality local universities |	Increased risk of out-migration as a result of the high cost-of-living|	Significant concentration of single-family homes and rentals |	Middle-of-the-pack employment growth forecasts relative to other SoCal markets
1|202|Apartment|Orlando|Orlando: Orlando is the most visited destination in the country with >70M annual visitors. With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, international travel has halted, damaging Orlando’s tourism-based economy and driving the unemployment rate to be among the worst of top markets in the early innings of the downturn. In recent years, Florida's business-friendly environment and the growth of the University of Central Florida have brought higher-wage jobs, such as professional services and health care, to the market, providing some insulation from Covid-19 fallout. Supply growth in Orlando is among the highest of top markets with the Southwest, South Central, and Maitland / Winter Park submarkets seeing the brunt of oncoming supply. Notable developments include downtown’s Creative Village, where UCF and Valencia’s shared campus opened in the summer of '19, bringing >7k students to downtown with long-term plans for ~15k students and >1.5k apartment units in the development. Despite supply growth concerns, investors should look to Maitland / Winter Park and South Central, particularly Thornton Park, for some of the market’s highest rents. Ultimately, investors should expect challenged near-term fundamentals as Orlando faces a tough recovery and struggles to absorb an elevated supply pipeline. In the long term, exceptional job and population growth create a healthy outlook for Orlando’s rent growth potential, though cap rates have compressed meaningfully in the market pre-Covid-19, tempering long-term return potential. |SunRail expanding in ’22 while Brightline to connect Orlando to Miami in ’21 and to Tampa in ’25 |Growing millennial and student population attracted to the market’s affordability and desirability|Thornton Park and Mills 50 are trendy neighborhoods that stand out for favorable demographics|Affordability of single-family homes threatens apartment demand |Concentration in hospitality industry has led to increased unemployment during Covid-19 pandemic |Limited geographic or regulatory barriers to supply 
1|203|Apartment|Palm Beach|Palm Beach: With population growth forecasts that best its South Florida peers and many top markets, Palm Beach is gradually evolving from a sleepy retirement town to an up-and-coming metro. Attracted to the market’s amenities, affordability, and low taxes, financial and business services companies have relocated to the metro while the hospitality and health care industries have also seen consistent growth. Virgin Trains USA now connects Palm Beach to Miami and will connect Palm Beach to Orlando in coming years. Supply growth, centered in the West Palm Beach, Lake Worth, and Boca Raton submarkets remains elevated, but has moderated after a spike in ‘17. Investors should look to the Boca Raton East submarket, which stands out for having the most educated population and the highest rents in the metro. Strong growth forecasts and a desirable lifestyle bode well for Palm Beach, ranking it above most top markets in terms of long-term rent growth potential and near-term M-RevPAF growth expectations. 	|Desirable coastal location entices new residents into the market	|Brightline connects Palm Beach to the rest of South Florida and will connect the metro to Orlando in ’21|Boca Raton East submarket has the most educated population and the highest rents in the metro|Concentration of retirees, ~25% of the population - more than any other top market, drives homeownership|Availability of land makes for a relatively affordable housing market and increases risk of oversupply|Foreign capital and visitors to remain muted through Covid-19 pandemic
1|204|Apartment|Philadelphia|Philadelphia: Philadelphia’s affordability versus other major East Coast markets (e.g., New York, D.C.) is a draw for some renters, but underwhelming job growth expectations sets the stage for below-average apartment fundamentals. The region’s large education and health care presence (e.g., University of Pennsylvania, Jefferson Healthcare system) provides stable employment, and a rapidly-growing life sciences industry has been a bright spot in Philly’s otherwise tepid economy, attracting strong venture capital inflows to the city (~$2.5B in ’19). The influx of tech funding paired with an abundance of local research facilities is expected to drive above-average income growth. The city’s punitive tax structure and unfriendly business environment largely limits major corporate relocations to the metro, and most cities that do set up shop choose to do so in the suburbs where taxes are less onerous. As such, there is a disconnect between where typical apartment renters live (CBD) and where the job growth is concentrated (suburbs). Investments in the city center and a drastically reduced crime rate have improved the city’s ability in retaining young talent (25-34 age cohort population growth has outpaced the overall average), but total population trends still prove worrisome. Philly’s capital flows are better than the city’s historic record, driven by smaller investors expanding outside of the surrounding metros in search of higher going-in yields.|Relative affordability compared to other East Coast markets|Education and health care employment base is relatively Covid-resilient|Strong university systems in the metro drive strong Human Capital score, above-average median household income|High taxes discourage economic growth and deter large companies from entering the market|Below-average population growth hinders new apartment renter demand|High homeownership rate weighs on rental pricing power
1|205|Apartment|Phoenix|Phoenix: Phoenix apartment fundamentals are bolstered by top-ranked job and population growth expectations. As a low-cost alternative to major California markets, Phoenix continues to draw residents from its neighbors to the west. Infosys, an IT services company, will move into the newly-delivered Novus Innovation Corridor in the North Tempe submarket once offices are able to reopen and intend to bring ~1k jobs to Phoenix by ’23. As additional companies are attracted to Tempe, apartment demand in the North and South Tempe submarkets should increase due to the walkable, urban amenities, and access to various transit alternatives. The Roosevelt Row (RoRo) neighborhood in the Downtown submarket is an up-and-coming neighborhood that is growing in popularity. Demand in Phoenix is expected to continue outpacing the high levels of supply for now, leading to relatively high levels of near-term M-RevPAF growth. Over longer periods of time, supply will likely catch up with demand, resulting in average long-term growth prospects. |Desirable quality of life for various age cohorts boosts long-term rent growth potential|Millennial population growth has been among the highest of the top markets since '16, bolstering demand|The relatively diverse economy and migration into the metro supports above-average M-RevPAF growth in the near-term |Affordable single-family market puts a ceiling on apartment demand|Low barriers to new supply; pipeline is primarily concentrated in the Downtown and North Scottsdale submarkets |An aggressive bid and low going-in yields have led to below-average return expectations
1|206|Apartment|Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh: Investors should exhibit cautious optimism when considering the “Steel City’s” apartment sector. While the Pittsburgh economy lags nearby East Coast metros due to its dependence on low-growth industries, a strong university system supports the nascent tech industry that is slowly gaining traction in the metro. Though employers like Apple, Facebook, and Google recruit from these universities that specialize in artificial intelligence, life sciences, and robotics projects, overall employment growth in other sectors remains poor and Pittsburgh’s tech scene is still growing off a low base. Much of the development and transactions in the apartment sector occur in the CBD and Oakland / East End submarkets. Here, investors find the highest rent growth potential while still yielding attractive going-in cap rates. These submarkets are changing from aging industrial buildings to new office and apartment developments. The $273M “3 Crossings” master plan is set to build 2 apartment buildings with ~300 units by ‘21, among other developments. Despite these emerging positive trends, caution should be exhibited as the metro battles high millennial out-migration rates as graduates from the metro’s elite university systems look toward more desirable markets for employment. Additionally, rent growth is limited by the metro’s lack of supply constraints and inexpensive home prices, which drive high homeownership rates. Pittsburgh displays one of the highest economic cap rates in the nation, but worrying long-term growth prospects deserve a watchful eye.|Low cost of living, below-average effective rents compared to other Northeast metros|Growing number of high-paying jobs centered in central business district|Strong demand and pricing power in Oakland / East End submarket |High level of outmigration to more desirable East Coast metros|Minimal supply barriers challenge rent growth potential|Elevated homeownership levels due to more affordable home prices
1|207|Apartment|Portland|Portland: Portland’s apartment fundamentals are driven by solid job and population growth among young adults looking for relative affordability and a high quality of life. The significant in-migration has resulted in robust rent growth over the last few years; however, developers have quickly caught on. Completions in ’19 reached an all-time high and while fewer new starts are now expected because of Covid-19, projects still in the pipeline will likely outpace demand in the coming years. Portland’s decision to enact statewide rent control has garnered national attention, and while the long-term impact of the new law remains unknown, it is expected to have a minimal effect on short-term apartment fundamentals since the 7+% inflation rent cap is far above rent growth projections. The concern lies within whether it will lead to tighter limits down the road that would negatively impact investors' ability to increase rents, hurting overall returns. A recently-passed measure that requires cities with >25,000 people to allow duplexes, triplexes, and quadplexes in areas zoned for single-family suggest already-low barriers to supply will ease further.	|Increasing home prices may drive a higher propensity to rent, boosting near-and long-term fundamentals|Companies’ expanding in Portland from larger West Coast and tech centric markets; above-average job growth|Growing concentration of TAMI and FIRE sector jobs entering the metro, providing for better household income growth|Heavy supply pipeline will put continued pressure on M-RevPAF growth|Growing concern for tighter rent-control measures in the metro and for additional state-wide housing legislation|New income tax increase, up to 3%, in Multnomah County may cause residents to relocate resulting in demand headwinds
1|209|Apartment|Raleigh-Durham|Raleigh-Durham: Raleigh’s demographic profile has improved meaningfully after benefiting from exceptional employment growth over the last cycle and experiencing an influx of younger age cohorts. The recent demographic trends are expected to continue with near-term employment growth forecasted to be amongst the strongest of our top markets. Proximity to top universities, affordable living costs, and desirable submarkets are some of the key factors behind Raleigh’s strong population growth and domestic in-migration trends. As a result of strengthening demographics, M-RevPAF growth forecasts are expected to outperform most of our top markets. Raleigh’s booming apartment demand, however, has not been overlooked by local developers, and with low barriers to development, supply growth should continue to restrain rent growth over the next few years. One notable project contributing to the elevated supply pipeline in ’20 and ’21 includes Midtown Exchange, a $1B mixed-use project that will include ~1,300 new apartment units. Strong long-term growth forecasts offset low going-in yields following cap rate compression in recent years, resulting in solid return expectations. |Favorable income and employment backdrop due to strong TAMI / life sciences sector|Low personal income tax rates and high-quality universities will continue supporting in-migration|Strong Human Capital score evidenced by high household income / college education rates in Cary and Central Raleigh|Above-average homeownership rates and an acceleration of single-family supply expected, notably in Northeast Raleigh|Apartment supply growth to outpace top markets, majority of development within central submarkets|Poor commute times in southern submarkets with poor Walk Score hampers market accessibility
1|210|Apartment|Richmond|Richmond: A relatively affordable lifestyle and decent Fortune 500 presence drive apartment demand in Richmond, including headquarters for notable companies such as Altria and Carmax. The local economy relies heavily on business services and government jobs. Despite the region’s favorable cost of business, job growth has lagged behind the top market average consistently since mid-’16 (though the trend  somewhat reversed in 1H’20). The departure of Building Commissioner Douglas Murrow in ’18, whose stringent policies and slow-moving approval procedures were a source of headaches for local developers, has already increased the ease of real estate construction and led to a record-high development pipeline. Approval of ~$3M in tax breaks for Lynx Venture’s proposed 165-unit building in the Downtown / The Fan submarket is emblematic of the city’s new pro-development policies. Revitalization efforts in the Scott’s Addition neighborhood and the Downtown / The Fan submarkets has attracted an influx of millennials.

1|212|Apartment|Sacramento|Sacramento: Fundamentals in Sacramento appear to be holding up nicely, with near-term M-RevPAF growth forecasted to outpace most top markets. As the Golden State capital, Sacramento benefits from strong and resilient employment in the public sector which has contributed to steady income growth over the last several years. The University submarket is likely to outperform others in Sacramento over the long term due to a denser population base and large presence of a younger renting cohort. As NIMBYism remains a significant impediment and lower rents make developments difficult to pencil, the supply pipeline is forecasted to remain relatively low. Though Sacramento struggles to compete with San Francisco and Silicon Valley for prominent tech interest, accelerating work from home trends could drive renter demand as employees are able to live further from their jobs and enjoy cheaper rents and  larger spaces. This trend has yet to fully play out and has room to run, thus long-term rent expectations in the market remain in line with the top markets. With high going-in yields relative to other California markets and healthy growth expectations, Sacramento boasts among the highest expected returns across the top markets. |CA’s regulatory and high-cost environment makes development challenging, creating favorable barriers to supply|Fundamentals in the University submarket are supported by the young, dense population and desirable quality of life|More affordable alternative to the Bay Area; should continue to attract new residents|Above-average homeownership rate across the metro limits renter demand, especially in Folsom and Fair Oaks|High-quality job growth has failed to catch momentum in the market|Car-dependent market with a relatively weak public transit system
1|213|Apartment|Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City: Salt Lake City’s economy continues to diversify as companies from various sectors are drawn to the metro’s business-friendly environment and deep talent pool. A large portion of the market’s strong population growth is concentrated among younger age groups who are attracted to the lifestyle and job market, fueling demand for apartments in the CBD submarket due to the close proximity to many offices and the relatively urban, walkable location. Developers have responded to this demand with the construction of notable developments including The Block 67 project and The Exchange, which will add a combined ~1k units by ‘21. Many of these luxury apartments are highly amenitized developments targeting millennials and new residents, but ~80 apartments in The Exchange will be left for affordable housing. Developers will be able to keep the vast majority of units at market rates, though, as the Utah government did not pass a bill to give cities the choice to impose rent control in 1Q’20. The flood of supply in the market has dampened what would have been otherwise robust fundamentals the last three years, but favorable demand should be more than enough to absorb units that deliver over the next few years. Long-term NOI growth is aided by solid fiscal health and the metro’s relative desirability, and a high initial yield combined with a favorable growth outlook make for attractive potential long-term returns. |High millennial growth attracted to cultural amenities and relatively affordable cost of living|Significant in-migration from younger demographics due to strong job market and affordability |Strong fiscal health limits income and property tax pressure seen in other metros|Homeownership is encouraged by market’s affordability|Limited barriers to supply hurt an already sprawling market|Low school rating decreases attractiveness for families migrating to the area
1|214|Apartment|San Antonio|San Antonio: Despite recent positive demand trends, the San Antonio apartment sector continues to face fundamental pressure stemming from the region’s housing affordability and lack of supply barriers. The metro has been a beneficiary of the fracking boom which has increased job and population growth, and it has also seen an increase in higher paying health care jobs; significant investment has been made to improve / expand health care facilities. Four large military bases provide stability and promote economic activity. Current rent and occupancy remain depressed from a large wave of new deliveries that hit the market in ’16 and ’17 during the energy recession, but stable demand supported by its exposure to the military has caused near-term M-RevPAF growth forecasts to be among the best of the top markets. Supply pipelines remain large in the near-term, while longer term, low barriers to entry, low levels of human capital, and large pockets of crime / poverty contribute to San Antonio’s mediocre long-term NOI growth prospects. The northern submarkets are better positioned than their southern counterparts, with the Northeast submarket standing out as a cut above the rest given its superior demographics. In aggregate, San Antonio screens middle-of-the-pack as compared with the rest of the top apartment markets regarding return expectations.|Stable economy is supported by a growing health care industry|Large military community reduces cash flow volatility|Low cost of living and desirable quality of life drive net migration|Small portion of population has attained a college degree|Housing affordability ranks high within the top markets, increasing the risk of homeownership|Elevated supply growth  limits pricing power
1|215|Apartment|Inland Empire|Inland Empire: With rental rates and home prices in Los Angeles and Orange County among the highest in the nation, many have turned to the neighboring Inland Empire as a cheaper housing alternative which has resulted in strengthening apartment fundamentals for the metro. The region’s position as a prominent west coast logistics hub has created thousands of new jobs—resulting in above-average population growth—and continues to drive decent housing demand. Chino and Corona, the closest submarkets to LA and OC, have seen the strongest renter demand due to above-average income levels and rising home prices. Given a severe housing shortage and overall lack of affordability, in 2H’19 AB 1482 was enacted by Governor Newsom implementing statewide rent control for renewal offers on apartments that are older than 15 years. The law will be in effect from January ’20 through January ‘30. Additionally, Prop 21, a measure to amend the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, will appear on the November ’20 ballot (a similar ballot measure failed in ’18), reigniting fear amongst landlords that local governments may be able to enact more restrictive forms of rent control. On the supply front, development has been dormant for much of this cycle, with most new deliveries being garden-style multifamily units. Single-family affordability and low-wage job growth relative to other Southern California metros will be among the largest long-term headwinds for apartment owners versus most West Coast markets.|Relatively low cost of living attracts residents from neighboring OC, LA, and SD markets|	Chino submarket has seen the strongest renter demand due to above-average income levels and rising home prices|The market's position as a prominent West Coast logistics hub has created thousands of new jobs|Single-family housing is affordable relative to other Southern California metros|Expected to underperform in the long term due to weak demographics and less desirable quality of life|Low TAMI employment weighs on income growth potential
1|216|Apartment|San Diego|San Diego: San Diego is consistently recognized as one of the most desirable places to live in the U.S. because of its pleasant climate, healthy demographics, and 70 miles of picturesque coastline. Fundamentals are supported by the strong university network that retains ~50% of students as full-time residents post-graduation, and home prices that remain unaffordable for recent graduates and most young families. The market is home to an array of headquarters including Sempra Energy and Qualcomm, along with a variety of employers that are drawn to San Diego’s talented workforce. New, highly amenitized supply growth is concentrated in the Downtown submarket, which has the lowest homeownership rate in San Diego at ~20%. San Diego has high supply constraints due to natural and legislative barriers. In Downtown San Diego, developers must comply with a 500-ft cap on buildings because of its close proximity to the airport. In 2H’19, AB 1482 was enacted by Governor Newsom implementing statewide rent control for renewal offers on apartments that are older than 15 years. The law will be in effect beginning January ’20 until January ‘30. Additionally, Prop 21, a measure to amend the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act will appear on the November ’20 ballot (a similar ballot measure failed in ’18), reigniting fear among landlords that local governments may be able to enact more restrictive forms of rent control. |Amenities in the CBD attract new residents  |Healthy job growth forecasts through ’25 in the health care sector should support stable apartment demand|Legislative supply barriers limit competition (e.g., building height restrictions in the CBD)|Redevelopments in the East village, Waterfront Park, and Horton Plaza may increase near-term supply |Slowing growth of the 25-34 age cohort as millennials seek more affordable markets  |Strong competition for talent from other California markets
1|217|Apartment|San Francisco|San Francisco: As a top tech hub with exceptionally high income levels, stable employment forecasts and one of the most educated population bases in the country, San Francisco remains among the most expensive places to rent. San Francisco continues to be one of the most difficult cities to build in, with NIMBYism, as well as geographic and regulatory barriers to development, impeding new supply. Political risk remains significant in the market as California, especially as leaders in Los Angeles and San Francisco, continue to tilt more populist and implement new legislation accordingly. Though Prop 10 (repeal of Costa-Hawkins Act, which limits the scope of rent control) lost in ‘18, the passage of AB 1482 in the state of California (limits annual rent increases to 5%),  took effect in early ’20. Similar campaigns are likely to pop up over the next several years with the most notable one being another potential repeal of Costa-Hawkins revisiting the ballot in November ‘20. Despite developing legislative headwinds, San Francisco’s long-term rent growth is likely to outperform most top markets largely as a result of the regulatory constraints and strong human capital. Further, homeownership in the Bay Area remains out of reach for many, especially in San Francisco, where the median home price reaches >$1M. It is worth noting that as work from home trends accelerate and companies (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) formulate plans for at least a portion of employees to permanently work remote, San Francisco’s high exposure to the tech industry may become a growing concern. Though going-in yields are low, elevated long-term NOI growth projections boost San Francisco toward the top of our return expectations across the  top markets. |High home prices keep homeownership out of reach for many, driving propensity to rent|	High-income jobs provide residents the ability to pay elevated rents |Demographics continue to rank among the top of the pack due to high household incomes and a highly educated workforce|Employer policies regarding work from home policies could cause permanent re-rating in rents|Political risk remains a concern as more progressive initiatives continue to arise|M-RevPAF growth forecasts are expected to remain weak in the near-term as Covid impacts denser metros 
1|218|Apartment|San Jose|San Jose: Big tech firms and their educated and well-compensated workforce drove much of the success in the South Bay market over the last cycle. In late ‘19, Facebook and Google announced plans to expand their presences by a combined ~8M SF in San Jose, creating space for an additional ~35k employees in the market. With multiple companies, including Facebook, expressing plans to shift a portion of employees to remote work solutions permanently, it remains unclear what portion of these jobs will be in the office full time as the secular shift to working from home continues to play out. In an attempt to improve the Bay Area housing crisis, Facebook, Google, and Apple have each pledged $1B to build additional housing and keep further home price appreciation at bay. Additional infrastructure projects include the ~$5.5B Silicon Valley BART expansion which will connect Oakland to San Jose and allow the workforce to travel between the metros more easily. Though affordable housing initiatives have become seemingly ubiquitous across California, favorable regulatory barriers remain in place, limiting future market rate supply growth. . While San Jose had been a relative winner of migration trends throughout much of the last cycle, near-term population growth forecasts appear to be in line with our top market average stemming from uncertainty related to the work from home shift. Though going-in yields remain low, and near-term growth prospects are stunted, strong long-term growth forecasts contribute to healthy return expectations.|Employment growth forecast expected to remain among the top of the pack|Favorable supply profile across the market with high regulatory and geographic barriers in place|Concentration of best-in-class tech companies and jobs |Political risk persists as progressive measures continue to arise (e.g., rent control) |Extremely expensive housing market may drive outmigration to more affordable metros|M-RevPAF growth expected to remain weak as the pandemic pressures denser metros
1|219|Apartment|Seattle|Seattle: The prominence of giant tech firms, including Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, continue to drive high-paying job growth to the region. Apartment fundamentals have greatly benefited from the rapid expansion of these tech companies as they compete for top talent in the metro. Just within the past year, Apple, Amazon, and Expedia have added a combined ~6,000 jobs to Seattle, primarily concentrated in the South Lake Union and Bellevue submarkets. Institutional capital interest in the region has ramped— and with it came a wave of new development. The South Lake Union, Bellevue, and Central submarkets, Seattle’s most expensive areas, are seeing the highest new supply, likely causing rent growth to slow as developments are completed. In addition, legislation was passed in ‘19 that will lower barriers to supply in several submarkets. Microsoft announced plans to invest $500M to provide affordable housing in the Kirkland, Bellevue, and Federal Way submarkets. Individuals looking for rent relief from Seattle’s most expensive areas are fueling new demand and boosting fundamentals in the submarkets of Everett, Kent, and Federal Way. Despite weakening demand from the impacts of the pandemic, Seattle’s long-term growth and return expectations are among the best relative to other coastal markets.  |Affluent and highly educated population base should support long-term rent growth|Amazon’s major expansion into Bellevue will likely fuel new demand and fundamentals in the surrounding area|Prominence of large tech firms continues to drive high-paying job growth and strong in-migration trends|Consistently elevated supply growth will likely cause future rent growth to slow, especially in the Central submarket|Higher-beta market due to economy’s dependence of a few large firms, notably Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Boeing|Increasing cost of living may increase regulatory requirements to include more affordable housing on new developments
1|220|Apartment|St. Louis|St. Louis: Fundamentals in St. Louis remain uninspiring as the market’s high exposure to low-growth sectors, such as manufacturing and trade, have rendered the local economy a laggard in terms of GDP and employment growth relative to other Midwest markets. While supply barriers remain low with few regulatory or geographic constraints, low growth and minimal demand have kept new development at bay. Given the market’s poor performance amidst a tepid supply pipeline, this trend is worrisome for local owners. Employment growth, which had been sluggish throughout most of the last cycle, will likely prove even more troublesome as employment trends are expected to slow amid the ongoing recession. A bright spot for the region has been Boeing and GM’s continued investment in the market; Boeing’s regional workforce has expanded by 2k jobs over the last couple years and GM recently invested $1.5B into their Wentzville truck factory. It remains to be seen how Boeing’s ongoing 737 troubles, further exacerbated by the current pandemic which has significantly reduced travel demand, will impact local hiring. Further headwinds for the St. Louis apartment market include an aging and stagnant population base as well as very affordable single-family homes. Relatively high going-in yields offset weak intermediate and long-term growth forecasts which results in a return profile that is expected to be in line with our top market average.|Employers like Boeing and Mercy Health preserve critical high paying jobs|Relative to other areas, Manchester and Clayton submarkets benefit from higher incomes and more educated residents|Diverse economy supported by various industries limits market volatility|Population growth forecasts significantly lag national average |Relatively affordable single-family home market and a high homeownership rate|High crime rates and low school ratings harm overall desirability; violent crime among highest in the nation
1|221|Apartment|Suburban Maryland|Suburban Maryland: The Suburban Maryland market has trailed both D.C. and Northern Virginia this cycle, with significant losses in both government and FIRE employment. Developers have been focusing their attention in Northern Virginia, a market supported by both military spending and a growing tech presence. Amazon’s choice of Crystal City for its HQ2 location will likely favor the closer Northern Virginia submarkets of Alexandria / Arlington over Maryland’s Bethesda / Silver Spring. Suburban Maryland has seen a “flight to quality” trend in recent years, with developers focusing on the repositioning of underperforming Class B space. JBG Smith has been unwinding a large portion of its portfolio (~$770M) to fund new residential / office developments. The firm is currently constructing a 475-unit Class A apartment complex in Bethesda that is set to deliver in 1Q’19. Construction of the Purple Line metro extension has the potential to noticeably boost apartment demand in the area by increasing connectivity to both D.C. and Crystal City.|More affordable than neighboring D.C. / VA|Construction of Purple Line to increase regional connectivity|Above average per capita income levels|Flat employment growth in FIRE / government sectors|Less appealing market to young adults|Northern Virginia more attractive for government defense jobs
1|222|Apartment|Suburban Virginia|Suburban Virginia: The Suburban Virginia market is currently enjoying its time in the lime-light following Amazon’s HQ2 announcement, in which the company stated its intention to split their HQ2 location between Crystal City, VA and Long Island City, NY. The new office is expected to bring in 25k highly compensated positions and ~$2.5B of infrastructure investment. Plans include a new entrance to the Crystal City metro stop and a pedestrian bridge connecting Crystal City to the Reagan National Airport. Heavy renovation plans to the metro line are already underway in the region, strengthening the public transit system. Connectivity to the nation’s capital by means of the metro line is a large driver of tenant demand. However, temporary closures beginning summer ‘19 may disrupt  peak leasing in submarkets like Alexandria, as longer-commute times dissuade prospective residents from living outside D.C. Northern Virginia’s dominance in the cyber security / data services industries further boosts employment expectations, as technological advances require efficient security capacities. Development activity will likely see an uptick in the near term to accommodate the influx of workers; JBGS, the developer behind the relocation, is already planning a 750-unit mixed-use complex set to break ground in ’20. |Silver Line expansion improves regional connectivity|High cost of ownership promotes renting|High median income with sizeable gains in skilled sectors|Large developments in Tysons Corner / Crystal City|Rail expansion drives transit-oriented development|Competition from D.C. / Maryland residential 
1|225|Apartment|Tampa-St. Petersburg|Tampa-St. Petersburg: Tampa’s strong population growth is largely driven by retirees, which tempers otherwise bright fundamentals. Law firm Baker McKenzie will open an innovation hub that will bring ~300 jobs to the Central Tampa submarket, and the health and life science research presence around the Moffitt Cancer Center continues to grow with Swedish biotech company Vycellix choosing Tampa for its U.S HQ. Supply growth in Tampa surpasses the top market average with new deliveries centered in the Central Tampa and Central St. Petersburg submarkets. In Central Tampa, investors should be wary of Midtown Tampa and Water Street, 2 mixed-use developments currently under construction that will bring ~1.7k units to the submarket. While traditionally a favorite for its healthy demographics, the Southwest Tampa submarket is also facing more supply. The Westshore Marina District has started construction and will add >1k apartments and condos, retail space, and a marina to the Southwest submarket. With an economy driven by local services and overall less sensitive to Covid-19 risk, Tampa is expected to perform well over the next 5 years, resulting in above-average M-RevPAF growth expectations. Over the long term, Tampa’s population growth and status as a desirable coastal market mitigate the effects of oversupply to support healthy long-term NOI growth for Tampa apartments.|Nonfarm employment contraction in ’20 outperformed top markets as labor market tilts towards defensive sectors|Favorable market desirability through leisure / low-tax environment should continue garnering in-migration|Demand for increases in space with WFH shift will likely benefit inventory within Central and Southwest Tampa|Recent in-migration trends and home price affordability has benefitted homeownership over rental demand|St. Petersburg initiatives to increase density along Coastal High Hazard region demonstrates weak supply barriers|School rankings are near bottom of top markets serving as a headwind for household formation
1|1264|Apartment|Honolulu|Honolulu: As one of the world’s top tourist destinations, the Honolulu economy primarily relies on the leisure and hospitality sectors which have faced large recent headwinds due to Covid-19. The island’s isolated location and high-cost environment make it difficult for businesses to justify moving into the market, leading to limited employment growth in other sectors. The ever-rising cost of living has led to population declines in recent years, and much of the loss has been concentrated in the 34-and-below age group. Despite these negative tailwinds, limited supply insulates apartment fundamentals on the island. The strict entitlement and permitting processes, along with high land prices, make development time consuming and pricey. To make up for affordability issues on the island, the local government is working to ease supply barriers. Recent legislation (Bill 7) was approved in ‘19 in hopes of encouraging the development of more affordable housing for Honolulu residents. The new law allows higher density apartments to be built on lots of <20k SF in exchange for requirements to charge rates deemed affordable on at least 80% of the units. Douglas Emmett is also in the process of converting a ~490k SF office building into ~500 apartment units over the next few years in the Central Honolulu submarket. An unclear outlook for the Honolulu economy, out-migration, and easing supply barriers call for intermediate-term growth to remain among the lowest of the top markets, hindering the island’s risk-adjusted return expectations. |Favorable weather and location boost the market’s desirability|The expensive housing market keeps homeownership out of reach for many, increasing apartment demand|The late ’20 vaccine news likely pulls forward the outlook for economic recovery and the return of tourism |Below-average long-term NOI growth prospects keep return expectations among the middle of the pack|Douglas Emmett is converting ~460k SF of office into ~500 apartments in Central Honolulu; first deliveries in 2H’20|There is a strong push from the local government for more affordable housing as cost of living continues to increase
1|1282|Apartment|Columbus|Columbus: While the capital of Ohio is economically outperforming its Midwest peers, decelerating job growth in the FIRE and TAMI sectors coupled with a lack of supply barriers limit long-term prospects for Columbus. The city’s strengths lie in the large presence of Fortune 500 companies that have helped attract young talent and greatly contributed to the metro’s economic growth. Ohio State University, one of the largest universities in the U.S., also provides a strong base of educated professionals (~40% of graduates stay in Columbus). Developers have been actively adding new supply to the metro as strong in-migration and business expansions have increased apartment demand. Most of the new supply is concentrated in the University / Downtown submarket, where demand for mixed-use space has accelerated. If job growth continues to meaningfully decline in high-paying industries, the significant supply pipeline may dampen future apartment fundamentals, especially as the long-term effects of Covid-19 are felt. Investors should also be wary of affordable single-family housing placing a cap on rent growth. Overall, Columbus’ educated workforce and millennial population are helping apartment demand, but low barriers to entry limit long-term NOI growth and return expectations.	|Strong government and university job presence provides stability in downturns like the Covid-19 induced recession|Strong university system provides sizeable talent pool for local businesses |Steady growth in the education and health services sector since ‘15|Low home prices and mortgage rates result in high homeownership rates|Out-migration of jobs in high paying industries such as TAMI|Low supply barriers allow supply to keep pace with demand
1|1316|Apartment|Dallas / Fort Worth|Dallas / Fort Worth: The sprawling DFW metro has many strong demand drivers but is still susceptible to large waves of new supply. DFW continues to be an attractive business destination as employers are drawn to the region’s business-friendly environment, affordability, and centralized location, and the quality of job growth has improved in recent years with higher paying finance and tech job growth gaining momentum.  Low physical and regulatory barriers to entry have resulted in inflated supply pipelines and a deluge of new deliveries. These units are being matched with robust demand, resulting in average intermediate-term M-RevPAF growth forecasts. Long-term NOI growth is negatively impacted by the ease with which new supply can be added to the market. A significant portion of new supply is focused in the northern neighborhoods of Plano / Frisco and in the University Park submarket. Given current pricing and the healthy intermediate outlook, returns are expected to be around the top market average. |25 Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in the metro (e.g., Southwest Airlines, AT&T, Lockheed Martin)|Employment growth and in-migration outpaces majority of top markets|Diversified economy reduces industry concentration risk|Affordable homes lead to higher homeownership rates and limit rent growth|Less restrictive requirements and quick approval timelines for new developments allows supply to keep pace with demand|Over 25% of occupations with muted income growth (e.g. education, transportation, etc.)
1|1521|Apartment|D.C. Metro|D.C. Metro: D.C. Metro apartment fundamentals have lagged most major markets this cycle, though prospects are improving in the near term, the stability of public sector hiring should lead to a shallower trough in apartment rents and occupancy versus other coastal markets. Over the intermediate term, a highly-educated labor force and positive momentum on the TAMI job growth front bode well for apartment fundamentals. Amazon’s move to Crystal City will likely prove a win for local apartment owners as the firm will attract an influx of highly compensated employees. The new jobs associated with HQ2, which in total represent a 10% expansion of tech jobs for the market, are likely to be phased in over the course of ~10 years. Along with Crystal City, the Southwest Waterfront and Nationals Park neighborhoods continue to be hotbeds for new Class A product. Supply growth is expected to remain steady over the coming years, preventing a meaningful re-acceleration in rent growth (similar to most markets). As the pandemic exacerbates many large state and city deficits that will likely require significant tax hikes to resolve (e.g., NYC and NJ), D.C. stands to benefit as one of the few gateway markets not burdened by poor fiscal health. Uncertainty around government spending may continue to be a headwind for the area, but the D.C. Metro offers attractive returns in a low-yield apartment world|Affluent and well-educated population supports high median household income levels and strong income growth potential |Increased government spending expected to bolster knowledge-based job creation|Diverse employment base provides a solid floor to fundamentals |Below-average population growth hinders demand profile|Competition from quickly growing suburbs that are easily accessible via Metrorail|Supply growth remains high especially relative to other gateway markets
6|150|Industrial|Atlanta|Atlanta: Atlanta’s pro-business environment continues to attract companies and drive steady job growth within the metro. In 3Q'19, BlackRock announced that its new innovation center will bring >1k tech jobs to the Northeast submarket, beginning in ’20. Google expanded its presence in Midtown in 4Q'19 while Microsoft announced its new Atlanta office, which will bring ~1.5k jobs to Midtown, in 2Q’20. The Midtown submarket, offering a walkable lifestyle adjacent to Georgia Tech, has garnered significant attention from developers with ~2k apartment units under construction. While overall supply growth in Atlanta is in line with the top market average, the Gwinnet submarket has seen outsized development. Cumberland and Buckhead remain favorable due to their relatively muted supply pipelines and strong demographics; Buckhead continues to attract millennials with its walkability, strong transport systems, and cultural amenities while residents seeking suburban living flock to the Cumberland submarket, located only 20 minutes from Downtown. Traffic congestion and poor infrastructure are still problematic across the metro, although the city and state plan to invest $2.5B to improve MARTA lines and offerings over the next 25 years. With healthy employment growth and an increasing tech presence, Atlanta boasts a strong long-term outlook and near-term M-RevPAF growth that bests most top markets.|Infrastructure improvements in ’21 will assist operational performance in the sector|Atlanta benefits from being a key metro for Southeast distribution, aided by proximity to Port of Savannah|Growing millennial population with higher ecommerce adoption|Supply expected to increase by ~4% of current stock in Airport / South submarket through ’22|Low occupancy levels in the metro as the current industrial stock is obsolete|Weaker household income near Airport / South submarket hampers M-RevPAF expectations
6|151|Industrial|Austin|Austin: Strong asset value appreciation for Austin apartments has been driven by robust demand from both employment and population growth. Austin has become a major tech hub and destination for skilled, young workers that is fueled by a deep talent pool from local universities, a vibrant culture, and relative affordability. Upcoming expansion plans by brand-name employers bode well for job growth momentum. Apple’s $1 billion campus development  will bring 15k new jobs in the area by ’22. Facebook, Google, and Oracle, and now Tesla are also expanding their presence in the metro. This population boom has caused once-affordable home prices to surge, giving apartment owners more room to push rents. Rental demand anchored by the millennial cohort has been focused in the Downtown / Northwest submarkets, and the area around The Domain. New development has also been concentrated in these areas. The supply pipeline remains elevated, but demand is expected to allow for above-average M-RevPAF growth. Barriers to entry in Austin, while less than coastal markets, are the highest in Texas which will help support long-term rent growth. There is also growing evidence of NIMBYism in the area as residents and the city council have expressed concerns over increased traffic and rapidly rising home prices. Strong fundamentals, coupled with relatively attractive cap rates compared to markets with similar growth, drive attractive risk-adjusted returns.|Large presence of younger demographic can drive ecommerce sales and require more distribution space|Above-average population growth|Grown interest in relocation of manufacturing jobs (e.g. Tesla’s Gigafactory & Apple’s Mac Pro facility)|Infrastructure has not kept pace with population growth|High property tax elevates tenant’s occupancy costs; reduces tenant’s willingness to lease renewals|High supply growth, few interstates, and increased competition from larger markets reduces demand from logistics firms
6|152|Industrial|Baltimore|The Baltimore market remains an intriguing option for investors shying away from the increasingly modest going-in yields presented by other East Coast markets. Fueled by growth in the information and professional services sectors, future economic growth in Baltimore is likely to outpace that of many of its Eastern seaboard peers. Notably, a strengthening high-tech sector largely comprised of cybersecurity firms continues to spill over from the neighboring D.C. Metro, bolstered by a highly skilled local workforce and the presence of major universities such as Johns Hopkins and the University of Maryland. Various suburbs intend to reap the benefits of this wave of cybersecurity growth; the Merriweather District development hopes to create a “center of gravity in the cyberspace community” while transforming the landscape of downtown Columbia. Such development is not limited to suburbs, however, as the massive Port Covington project seeks to breathe new life into Baltimore City. Despite such efforts over the long term, current headwinds include high crime rates and severely entrenched urban poverty, rendering Baltimore City a less attractive region in which to live and work. Higher cap rates may attract some yield-oriented investors, but poor intermediate-term growth and a fairly restrained long-term outlook should be a drag on returns. |Washington County is developing into an industrial hub; developers purchasing land in anticipation of future demand|Transportation and warehousing sectors have lower operating costs than D.C.; expected to spur near-term job creation|Land constraints in select submarkets mirror other Northeast coastal markets|Below-average population density and population growth expectations hinders meaningful last-mile demand|Low land values in Baltimore City and Baltimore County East submarkets equate to below-average effective rents|Neighboring markets have been more competitive logistically 
6|154|Industrial|Boston|Boston: The market continues to attract an outsized share of knowledge-based workers as employers are drawn to a well-educated population anchored by a top university system. Employers like Amazon, Foundation Medicine, Klaviyo, and Google are expanding in or relocating to Boston, bringing thousands of high-paying jobs to the metro. Millennial population continues to grow as recent graduates chase these high-paying jobs. In addition to in-migration, apartment demand is supported by some of the highest home prices across top markets, delaying homeownership for many renters. A healthy demand backdrop combined with an average supply pipeline will help the city overcome short-term struggles brought on by the pandemic, leaving Boston among the strongest gateway markets for intermediate growth potential. Healthy demand can be found in Boston’s downtown submarkets given a desirable lifestyle and proximity to work. Investors should be aware of the “Imagine Boston 2030” master plan and its aim to make the market more affordable by ‘30 through increased mixed-use development which will add apartment inventory to the metro. Solid long-term growth prospects, should provide investors with attractive risk-adjusted returns relative to most metros.|Wealthy population base aids the outlook for further ecommerce growth |Long-term return expectations are boosted by above-average long-term growth prospects|Demand is aided by local biomanufacturing as life science continues to expand in the market|With a primary focus on local distribution, fundamentals have a heavier reliance on the state of the local economy|Functionally obsolete and aging facilities throughout the metro|Low supply barriers in the 495 South submarket with ~2M SF under construction
6|156|Industrial|New Jersey (Central)|New Jersey (Central): The Central New Jersey apartment market has proven a stable but low-growth market this past cycle. The long-term outlook remains underwhelming due to concerning fiscal health trends and sluggish employer growth. The state’s “Grow NJ” program, which provided tax incentives for companies that created or retained jobs in the region, had little success in Central New Jersey and finally expired in July ’19. The state’s concerning fiscal health (debt burden >$200B), which will likely be much worse following Covid-19, should deter investors as property tax increases to raise government funds would cut directly into the bottom line. Green Street estimates that a ~700 bp increase to the median resident’s non-federal tax burden is required to offset the state’s unfunded liabilities, which translates to an ~8% decline in after-tax income. Princeton University’s younger demographic provides steady rental demand for landlords in the Mercer / Princeton submarket, but the metro struggles to keep graduates from relocating to surrounding metros with better job prospects (e.g., New York, D.C., Boston). Stagnant population growth has pressured investors’ ability to push rents, and millennial out-migration forecasts will likely continue to weigh on long-term demand.|Proximity to a large population base and Northern New Jersey intermodal network|More affordable rents  than Northern New Jersey driving tighter occupancies|Strong intermediate- and long-term NOI growth  forecasts supported by robust fundamentals|Development moratorium delayed projects but surge of completions coming in near term|Competes with nearby markets (Philadelphia, Northern NJ) for tenants|Poor state fiscal health could lead to future tax hikes
6|158|Industrial|Charlotte|Charlotte: Strong domestic in-migration and employment growth have provided nice tailwinds for apartment fundamentals. Young adults have flocked to North Carolina’s most populous metro, drawn by Charlotte’s diverse range of employment opportunities, relative affordability compared to other East Coast hubs, and a dynamic live / work / play environment. The quality of job growth has improved in recent years, fueled by the array of employers that operate in Charlotte and those that are choosing to expand in the market (e.g., Lowe’s, U.S. Bank, Honeywell). Developers have been active and there has been a focus on mixed-use development along the LYNX Blue Line metro, with a new delivery at seemingly every stop. In 4Q’19, Charlotte’s City Council voted to spend $50M for a transportation firm to design a 26-mile Silver Line light-rail connecting the East submarket to Uptown and westward into Gaston County, despite ongoing concerns about how the city will fund the ~$4B project. As competition for tenants increases, landlords have been forced to offer more amenitized space to differentiate their product. Supply growth across the metro is showing no signs of slowing, and though absorption has been healthy investors should remain cautious of the elevated supply pipeline over the next 5 years, especially if economic growth remains sluggish in the next few years. Demand in Midtown and Downtown should stack up favorably as young adults have demonstrated a strong propensity to rent in these submarkets. |Strong growth in North Carolina port volume in ’20 demonstrates robust economic activity|Developed rail systems with favorable access to Charlotte airport allows for operational efficiencies|Population growth expected to outpace national average by ~3x through ‘25|Excess supply in Central and Northeast submarkets has led to drop in market occupancy and lower M-RevPAF expectations|Low supply barriers; city approved plans to develop ~1.5 million SF of industrial space in East Charlotte through ‘22|Traffic congestion within key eastern Charlotte industrial submarkets hampers last mile delivery
6|160|Industrial|Chicago|Chicago: The “Capital of the Midwest” exhibits stronger near-term apartment fundamentals than nearby Midwest markets, but Chicago still suffers from concerning long-term demographic and fiscal health trends. Owners are pressured by increasing tax liabilities from reassessed property values as the city / state try to alleviate fiscal woes. Additionally, a November ’20 ballot measure proposes graduated individual income tax rates between 4.95%-7.99%, changing from a current fixed rate of 4.95%. While increasing taxes hurts disposable income and has contributed to some out-migration, the modest silver lining is limited new supply in the market since developers are hesitant of the metro’s higher taxes and rising construction costs. Investors should be aware of the $6B Lincoln Yards master plan, which will phase in ~6k apartment units to the Lincoln Park / Old Town submarket over the intermediate term. In addition to fiscal issues, the metro suffers from millennial out-migration and unattractive employment trends, losing share to markets with higher-paying job opportunities. The wealthy population that resides in the Glencoe / Wilmette submarket, which falls outside of city limits (and thus outside of Chicago’s fiscal issues), pay some of the highest nominal rents across the market. Landlords have been able to consistently push rent in this submarket despite overall metro headwinds.|International logistics hub – 6 Class 1 railroads, robust highway system, and O’Hare airport|Strong income growth should bolster ecommerce demand|~25% of the U.S. population and select Canadian cities are in range of 1-day drive|Limited supply barriers promote speculative development, weighing on occupancies|Mid-pack going-in yields and subpar long-term growth drive poor return expectations|CPPI appreciation lags top market average as investors look to markets with healthier fiscal and demographic trends
6|161|Industrial|Cincinnati|Cincinnati: Cincinnati’s growth is broadly driven by its exposure to a few large corporate headquarters, including Kroger, Proctor & Gamble, and Macy’s. While large companies have helped propel job growth this last cycle, primarily in the finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE) sectors, a troubled manufacturing industry and lackluster population growth will likely weigh on apartment demand. Proximity to Columbus’ more stable job market hurts Cincinnati’s ability to attract young talent and prevent millennials from migrating. Very affordable single-family housing has also resulted in one of the highest homeownership rates relative to the top markets, which limits an investor’s ability to push apartment rents. One positive for the metro is Proctor and Gamble’s and Kroger’s strong quarterly earnings and forward-guidance in late ‘19, both of whom were facing challenges over the past few years. Despite an encouraging trajectory early in the year for P&G and Kroger, Covid-19 has disrupted future hiring plans for two of Cincinnati’s largest employers. In addition, Macy’s plans to slash ~3,900 corporate and management jobs as part of a restructuring plan will likely further dampen apartment fundamentals.

6|162|Industrial|Cleveland|Cleveland: A lack of young talent and weak job growth point to a continuation of poor apartment fundamentals. Once a manufacturing powerhouse, Cleveland has failed to redefine itself as globalization and technological innovation continue to leave many Rust Belt cities behind. The city suffers from significant out-migration, which is expected to continue over the next 5 years led by a decline in young adults who are relocating for better opportunities. Cleveland’s lone bright spot and best hope for reversing momentum remains in health care. The Case Western Reserve University Medical School and the Cleveland Clinic are large providers of high-paying jobs and economic activity. Investments in the life sciences is underway at the Cleveland Clinic’s research centers that may help generate some growth. However, it remains doubtful that the health care sector’s job growth in isolation will be able to resuscitate the local economy.  The Downtown submarket is demonstrating emerging strength due to a modernization effort by the Downtown Cleveland Alliance to create an innovation district. Despite development initiatives to generate an increasingly vibrant downtown area, Cleveland still struggles to compete with more desirable Midwest markets.	|Amazon increased its presence in Northeast Ohio, including two leases in 2Q’20 (~603k SF) in Greater Cleveland|Better Human Capital score in the East submarket could aid ecommerce demand|Central location benefits transportation of goods to the rest of the U.S.|Competition for tenants from other Midwest and Ohio markets, particularly Cincinnati  |Reliance on a struggling manufacturing industry|Low supply barriers, particularly in the Portage County submarket, stifle rent growth potential
6|168|Industrial|Denver|Denver: Denver continues to attract jobs from a diverse set of employment bases. YoY TAMI job growth  has been trending at an average of ~4% each month since the beginning of ’19. TAMI growth is supported by the in-migration of several startups and small tech firms, along with tech giants such as Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, and Apple. High-quality job opportunities, coupled with Denver’s desirable quality of life and access to nature, have attracted many young residents, making “The Mile-High City” a hot spot for millennial migration. Millennial demand has skyrocketed in trendy neighborhoods such as the LoHi / Highlands neighborhood in the Golden / Wheatridge submarket, and the RiNo Arts District in the Northeast submarket. Demand in the Downtown submarket is bolstered by the walkable, urban environment. Continued interest from affluent, highly-compensated millennials in these submarkets should allow for strong rent growth potential. The market’s low initial investment yields are offset by solid long-term growth, driving above-average risk-adjusted returns.|Metro forecasted to have economic growth above the national average through ‘25|Density of young, high earning workforce improves ecommerce demand; growth opportunities for distribution|The Central 70 project will increase flow on a major arterial highway and will be completed in ‘22|Transport is dependent on only two interstates and airport; no access to seaport|Standalone market with no nearby metros reduces distribution attractiveness |Low barriers to supply in parts of the market with greenfield, undeveloped land
6|169|Industrial|Detroit|Detroit: Optimism in the “Motor City” is fading as employment figures weaken and investment in the market is failing to provide substantial and sustainable improvement. Economic growth is expected to lag the rest of the Midwest through the intermediate term, even with substantial investments from billionaire Dan Gilbert and national automotive companies. The metro is hindered by continued dependence on stagnating industries and fails to make a meaningful economic shift toward higher-growth industries. TAMI jobs have seen consistent net outflow for years, and overall employment growth in Detroit ranks among the lowest across top markets (~35% of the population lives below the poverty line). The lack of well-paying jobs hampers in-migration as new graduates and millennials choose more desirable markets that offer better compensation to start their careers. Tepid demand from minimal population and job growth mixed with low supply barriers provide a weak intermediate-term outlook for the apartment sector. Additionally, rising construction costs are leading developers to rethink their plans or ditch them all together as rents cannot keep up with increasing development costs. This is exemplified in projects like the East Jefferson Meijer, originally planned as a 213-unit mixed-use apartment / small-format grocer development that was abandoned in favor of a larger-format grocery store and parking lot. While the market has improved substantially since its bankruptcy in ‘13, the outlook still looks bleak.|Solid interstate infrastructure enables efficient distribution; access to ~33% of U.S. population in a 1-day drive|Larger blue-collar labor base makes the metro more attractive for ecommerce|Amazon’s growing presence serves to validate the market|Significant dependence on the auto / manufacturing industries which accounts for a large portion of industrial stock|Lack of Class A stock, aging inventory, and harsh winters may cause additional capital expenditures|Long-term outlook dampened by the effects of continued out-migration, lack of job growth, and minimal supply barriers
6|171|Industrial|Fairfield County|Fairfield County: Statewide fiscal concerns and tepid job growth continue to suppress apartment fundamentals in Fairfield County. Outsized municipal debt and unfunded liabilities have forced higher tax rates, a major determinant for several corporate HQ departures over the past few years (e.g., GE to Boston, Starwood to Miami). Fairfield County has not been able to attract any large relocations to backfill those gaps left behind. Meanwhile, the metro continues to face the headwinds of a shift from active to passive investment management, though FIRE employment improved in '18 after 22 consecutive months of YoY job declines. The market serves as a suburban living alternative to Manhattan which attracts more families looking to live in homes than rent apartments. Millennial population growth continues to decelerate as more prefer to live closer to Manhattan-based jobs.  While limited new construction will support apartment rent growth, unfavorable demographics and fiscal health issues should handcuff long-term NOI growth.|Favorable supply dynamics; little new stock|Affluent and ecommerce-utilizing population|Old average age makes new properties more desirable|Little institutional interest; not known as an industrial market|Concerning statewide fiscal health|Scope of industrial reach limited; mostly local demand
6|172|Industrial|Fort Lauderdale|Fort Lauderdale: Moderate job and population growth paired with middle-of-the-pack supply growth create a mixed outlook for Fort Lauderdale apartments. While tourism has historically been the primary economic growth driver, Fort Lauderdale’s economy is diversifying with a promising life sciences sector and steady job growth in the FIRE and professional / business services industries. The Fort Lauderdale, Plantation, and Miramar / Pembroke Pines submarkets have seen the most supply as developers seek opportunity north of Miami. Las Olas Boulevard in the Fort Lauderdale submarket has attracted significant development due to its walkable lifestyle and downtown feel. Las Olas Walk, a mixed-use development, will add ~1,200 luxury rental units to the submarket by late '20. For favorable demographics and a limited supply pipeline, investors should look to the Davie submarket, which boasts the wealthiest and most educated residents in the metro.  While Fort Lauderdale’s coastal location and steady job growth support a healthy rent profile, the market’s outlook is moderated by condo oversupply in the near term and a lack of meaningful supply barriers over the long term. |$400M effort to deepen and widen channels at Port Everglades underway and to be complete by ’25|Southeast Broward submarket benefits from coastal supply barriers, access to I-95, and a dense population|Strong population growth to support healthy ecommerce demand|Hurricane risk heightens cap-ex burden, insurance costs|Job growth concentrated in low-wage industries|Low interstate connectivity and lack of major airport cargo hub weakens industrial demand
6|177|Industrial|Houston|Houston: After being impacted heavily by the energy bust in ’15, Houston’s economy is still recovering. A silver lining of the energy recession is a slightly more diversified economy; the health care sector has seen growth, exemplified by Texas Medical Center becoming the world’s largest medical complex. Petrochemical manufacturing and other downstream energy activities have also experienced outsized growth. Although Houston has diversified its economy in recent years, the 1Q’20 collapse in oil prices and Covid-19 pandemic have presented additional challenges for the market. A large amount of supply was delivered directly into the energy recession and is still being absorbed by the market, as evidenced by below-average occupancy rates. Now, given the current uncertain economic environment, the already-present vacancy rate troubles will likely be prolonged. The current supply pipeline, while not massive, is large enough to continue to put downward pressure on intermediate-term M-RevPAF growth. A lack of zoning laws and a sprawling metroplex provide little regulatory or physical barriers to entry, suppressing long-term growth. Investors should look west towards the Montrose / River Oaks and Museum submarkets where there are higher incomes, more expensive housing, and elevated rents, but in aggregate expect below-average long-term returns, as higher going in yields are offset by lackluster long-term NOI growth potential.|Demand for industrial assets is supported by trade activity from one of the busiest ports in the country|Northeast and Southeast submarkets have access to over 20 interstates and docks along the Port of Houston|Leasing activity extending to large buildings as an effect of a growing population base |Lack of adequate zoning laws result in low barriers for supply|Large supply of available land along the outskirts of the market|Regional assets are sensitive to crude oil prices
6|178|Industrial|Indianapolis|Indianapolis: The capital of the “Hoosier State” has little to offer apartment investors in terms of long-term rent growth, as structural headwinds stemming from poor demographics and minimal supply constraints create a challenging environment. The job growth occurring is largely seen in the warehouse and manufacturing sectors which, combined with an outflow of high-paying TAMI jobs, limits income growth potential. While a quicker Covid-19 recovery is expected in Indianapolis over the next few years, the market should revert to below-average long-term growth relative to other top markets. Rent growth is constrained by affordable homeownership options available throughout the metro, and despite low regulatory and physical barriers, supply growth screens below average. Most of the development occurring in the metro can be found in the Downtown and Southwest submarkets. Meanwhile, the surrounding suburban submarkets exhibit the highest median incomes in the metro and have had more success in attracting investors (e.g., Spruce Capital, who purchased a ~1k unit suburban portfolio in early ’20). Though strong intermediate-term growth and high going-in yields screen attractive on the surface, affordable home prices allow renters to quickly transition into homeowners, hurting long-term rent growth potential.|FedEx’s secondary air hub at the airport attracts national distributors|Investors drawn to the pro-business environment that boasts low taxes|A strong freeway system allows ease of distribution throughout the United States |Flat topography, expansive land availability limits market rent growth |Competition from other Midwest markets|Weak demographics limit the benefits of last-mile ecommerce demand
6|179|Industrial|Jacksonville|Jacksonville: While healthy population and job growth bode well for apartment demand in Jacksonville, supply growth concerns weigh heavily on long-term rent growth potential. The Southside submarket is seeing the bulk of oncoming supply as it has both cheap land for development and is home to a younger and more educated population. The Arlington and Downtown submarkets are also seeing significant supply growth, particularly as the city and developers try to revitalize downtown to attract and retain more residents.  Notable developments include the District, a $600M mixed-use development on the Southbank that will add ~1k residential units, a hotel, and a marina to the metro. Near the Southbank, San Marco is seeing substantial development with ~800 units to be added by '21. Investors should look to the Beaches submarket, which benefits from the market’s highest rents and limited supply along the coast. Strong population and employment growth will help Jacksonville weather the upcoming recession reasonably well, leading to above-average near-term M-RevPAF growth; however, the lack of any meaningful barriers to supply outside of the coast restrains long-term rent growth potential.   |Tax environment / affordability encouraging demand|JAXPORT’s diverse business mix has steadily grown, benefitting from overall east coast market shift|~$75M JAXPORT expansion project expected for completion in ‘23|Poor interstate connections throughout the market hampers industrial delivery|Smaller millennial population and unfavorable population density an unfavorable backdrop for ecommerce penetration|Robust near-term development pipeline, with considerable expansion in Northside Jacksonville
6|180|Industrial|Kansas City|Kansas City: A shallower trough in Covid-induced job losses versus most markets and solid expected intermediate growth are bright spots for Kansas City, but the metro’s longer-term return prospects continue to be hampered by structural headwinds. While the market’s supply pipeline remains below-average, new units will likely struggle to be absorbed in the face of subpar income and population growth. Employers such as the USDA and CarMax have chosen to establish new operations within the market, attracted by low costs of living and doing business. Existing companies such as Cerner, Garmin, and Burns McDonnel have all announced that they are expanding their footprint in the metro with plans to add over 18k combined jobs in the next few years (~3% expansion of the existing non-farm workforce). While hiring by these companies and efforts to improve local transportation infrastructure may help the metro recover from the Covid-19 fallout more quickly over the intermediate term, the metro’s continued inability to draw high-paying employers results in unfavorable long-term growth, driving below-average risk-adjusted returns.|Manufacturing sectors make up ~10% of local GDP, with heavy influence from large automotive production|Future KCI Intermodal BusinessCentre will create strong distribution access along with tax benefits |Strong intermodal transportation network; highest amounts of rail traffic of any metro|Low barriers to supply |Low density and income levels lead to less overall online spending; local last-mile demand should be relatively muted|Landlocked nature does not offer any opportunity for large scale shipping traffic, no port access
6|182|Industrial|Las Vegas|Las Vegas: Above-average job growth has bolstered Las Vegas apartment fundamentals in recent years, but this trend has dramatically reversed with Covid-19’s outsized hit on the hospitality and leisure industries. The market now faces all-time high levels of unemployment, among the worst of the top markets. The economy’s heavy reliance on the tourism and hospitality industries has proven to be an extreme risk, and its health will greatly depend on the future progression of the virus and the availability of a vaccine. Though jobs are expected to return in the future, and the Allegiant Stadium completion is expected to create ~1.2k new jobs, apartment demand will continue to face long-term fundamental headwinds created by a cheap single-family market that incentivizes homeownership and lower-paying job growth. As residents continue to migrate from California, many immediately look at investing in a home as housing prices are very affordable relative to the high-cost, West Coast markets. A strong focus on single family development has kept apartment supply in check, a positive for owners, but very low going-in yields combined with an uncertain path of recovery over the long-term limit investors’ return potential.|Strong population growth fuels local ecommerce demand|Short distances to interstates within the market makes for efficient local distribution channels|No corporate income tax has created a business-friendly environment|Despite recent population growth, demand is still heavily dependent on tourism traffic|One of the largest supply pipelines of the top markets with construction primarily concentrated in the North submarket|No seaport access (too far to LA / LB) and poor interstate connectivity to other top markets hinders mass distribution
6|185|Industrial|Long Island|Long Island: After underwhelming job growth through much of the recent upcycle, Long Island’s local economy was one of the worst performers among the top  markets following the onset of the recession. The health care and education sectors, which have historically been a bright spot for job growth, experienced net declines throughout 1H’20, though the metro’s large government sector (~15% of jobs) held up relatively well. Long Island’s apartment demand generally benefits from New York City spillover, but this effect may be limited in the near term as the city grapples with economic fallout from the pandemic. It remains to be seen if tech growth in NYC will continue at its recent pace given the city’s fiscal issues and the acceleration in working from home, but already-announced expansions in ’19 (e.g., Google, Facebook, and Amazon) will provide incremental apartment demand. However, this will largely be confined to NYC’s urban core and Long Island submarkets in close proximity to Manhattan (i.e., Hempstead). Nearly 30% of Long Island’s population is between the ages of 45-64, among the highest across the top markets. As such, the region will likely never be a top destination for apartment investors due to its older, homeowning demographic, but a light supply pipeline should mitigate the job loss impact on rent growth to an extent.|Dense, affluent population base drives last-mile demand|Strict regulations limit supply growth; tilts supply-demand dynamic in landlords’ favor|Fundamentals less sensitive to economic downturns|Poor geographic location relative to NE peers; lacks multi-modal infrastructure to be a strong distribution market|Aging stock may become obsolete; limits tenant base|Concerning employment and population trends
6|186|Industrial|Los Angeles|Los Angeles: The LA apartment market is comprised of many cities across a vast geographic area and contains some of the highest barrier-to-entry submarkets in the nation (e.g., Santa Monica, Malibu Hills). Demand for housing in LA continues to exceed available supply, putting pressure on renters in a high-barrier, landlord-favored market. In 2H’19, AB 1482 was enacted by Governor Newsom implementing statewide rent control for renewal offers on apartments older than 15 years. The law will be in effect from January ’20 until January ‘30. Additionally, Prop 21, a measure to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, will appear on the November ’20 ballot (a similar ballot measure failed in ’18), reigniting concern amongst landlords that local governments may be able to enact more restrictive forms of rent control. Prospective investors should look west of the I-405 freeway, known as the Westside, for the strongest long-term rent growth potential as these highly desirable and supply-constrained submarkets are supported by healthy demographics and solid high-paying job growth. Los Angeles is one of the most highly regulated markets in the U.S., as geographical barriers, NIMBYism, and elevated construction costs keep supply in check. Tight supply dynamics and robust demand will continue to contribute to strong long-term NOI growth for the market.|Proximity to Ports of LA and Long Beach, ranked as the #1 and #2 container ports in the U.S., respectively|Vital distribution hub for the Western U.S. due to its access to the LA / Long Beach Ports, LAX airport, and critical freeways|LA's scarcity of land and high population density supports one of the strongest LT industrial outlooks nationwide|Majority of the inventory is older and built on smaller footprints with lower clear heights|Local and state policies tend to be unfavorable to business|High rents may cause industrial users to relocate to the nearby, comparable Inland Empire 
6|187|Industrial|Louisville|Louisville: With a regional focus and high employment concentration in manufacturing and other traditionally low-growth industries, Louisville’s economic prospects remain muted as compared with its Midwest peers. Some job growth has occurred in the metro, but mainly in the low-wage manufacturing and wholesale sectors; employment growth in the higher-paying TAMI and FIRE industries has been virtually nonexistent. A lack of demand stemming from minimal job growth is exacerbated by the metro’s relatively less desirable lifestyle, evident by minimal millennial population inflow. Demand headwinds and lack of  supply barriers limit a landlord’s ability to push rent. Additionally, the market’s low cost of living  drives homeownership relative to other metros, further hindering long-term rent growth. Like much of the Midwest, high going-in yields appear attractive, but there is little upside as the metro’s underwhelming outlook over the intermediate and long term limit return expectations.|UPS’ Worldhub presence has helped to revive the metro into a productive logistics hub|Central location allows for access to ~35% of the U.S. population in a 1-day drive, boosting industrial fundamentals|Supply barriers higher than neighboring Midwest, Southeast metros due to topography|Grim demographics relative to the top markets; below-average median income and poor education levels|Lack of exposure to TAMI and FIRE sectors which typically brings higher-paying jobs to the metro|Near-and long-term outlook dampened by the effects of limited job growth and minimal supply barriers
6|188|Industrial|Memphis|Memphis: The Memphis economy continues to miss out on the wave of growth in the technology and professional services industries that has propelled other southern metros. Concentrated in the trade and manufacturing sectors, Memphis’s undiversified and stagnant economy establishes a low ceiling on rent growth as high-paying jobs are few and far between. One of the few strengths of the markets lies in its low cash flow volatility, bolstered in part by a handful of Fortune 500 HQs. As the economy continues to find its footing amidst an on-going recession, Memphis’s low tech exposure contributes to a near-term M-RevPAF growth prospect that is expected to slightly outperform our top market average. TAMI and FIRE employment bases in Memphis are small and growing at a meager pace. Demographics in the ‘Home of Blues’ also bode poorly, as population growth significantly lags that of other southern metros and low-to-middle income households comprise a larger share of the market than the national average. Poor market fundamentals and struggling demographics, compounded by an active supply pipeline, present headwinds that render Memphis’ return profile among the least attractive in the country.|Sophisticated intermodal infrastructure allows access to air, rail, road, and river|Favorable incentives offered to businesses to operate in Memphis (e.g., tax, training, utility, and financing)|Central hub for distribution of goods for the Southeastern US|Aggressive tax abatements for new development encourage new supply, limit market rent growth for existing properties|Lack of employment and income growth expectations limits potential demand for last-mile assets|Low barriers to supply have increased the number of speculative projects
6|189|Industrial|Miami|Miami: Miami’s business-friendly environment and cultural amenities support healthy demographics and long-term apartment fundamentals. Since '13, Miami has seen domestic out-migration, largely to other Florida metros, as some residents are priced out of the growing city; however, international immigrants and high-earners seeking low taxes have driven steady per-capita income growth (average income of a person moving to Miami has exceeded those leaving). Miami’s low-tax environment has also attracted a growing tech / finance presence and solid job growth in the metro. Elevated supply, largely in the Downtown, Opa-Locka, and Miami Beach submarkets, remains a concern but is outweighed by strong demand growth, resulting in a healthy near-term M-RevPAF growth forecast. In the Downtown submarket, the trendy Wynwood and the Design District neighborhoods are seeing notable supply in response to their popularity with millennials, while Little Haiti has been pegged as the next neighborhood to gentrify. Investors should also take note of Miami Worldcenter, a mixed-use project that will add ~1.9k new apartment units to the Downtown submarket by '21. Brickell remains a favorite submarket for its central location and strong demographics while Coral Gables stands out for its minimal supply pipeline. As a desirable metro with favorable demographics, Miami’s long-term rent growth potential for apartments is among the best of our top markets. 	|Substantial investment planned for PortMiami, the nation’s 11th busiest port, to improve transportation access|Dense and wealthy population bodes well for ecommerce demand|MIA is the nation’s top airport for international freight and handles ~80% of air cargo from Latin America|Low highway connectivity relative to top markets|Hurricane and flooding risk increases insurance costs|High traffic congestion in metro
6|191|Industrial|Minneapolis|Minneapolis: Despite a number of large, stable employers, a full construction pipeline is weighing on Minneapolis’ intermediate rent growth outlook. Long-term advantages for the market include an outsized presence of S&P 500 companies and an educated labor force from nearby universities. However, local health care employment growth decelerated meaningfully throughout ’19 and bears watching moving forward. Local housing policy changes are further complicating the picture for apartment investors; Minneapolis’ “2040 Comprehensive Plan” upzones the majority of the city and effectively decreases supply barriers for much of the market. Furthermore, inclusionary zoning efforts are currently underway, intending to mandate that a portion of newly developed units be set aside as affordable housing. Currently, an interim plan is in place with the intention of more robust legislation being enacted. Elevated new supply and tepid employment growth over the coming years result in below-average market rent growth and weak long-term growth estimates.|High levels of disposable income and large millennial presence helps to catalyze ecommerce growth|Investor interest and liquidity are improving, rolling 12-month investment volume in early 3Q’20 at $1.9B|Steady fundamentals with usually rational supply pipelines|Isolated geographic location and lack of cheap warehouse labor reduces demand from national distributors|Lack of supply barriers throughout most of the market limit market rent growth potential|Older industrial age stock and harsh winters may cause additional capital expenditures
6|192|Industrial|Nashville|Nashville: Nashville’s educated workforce, relative affordability, and significant population growth have attracted large companies to the metro. Alliance Bernstein is relocating its global headquarters, which will bring ~1,050 jobs to Nashville, and Amazon plans to bring another ~5,000 jobs to its new downtown operations hub, both of whom began hiring in '19 and will continue to hire through '24. The meaningful job growth over the past couple years has been a positive tailwind for apartment fundamentals. As rents climbed over the past several years during this local economic boom, regulators have altered zoning laws that allow for more developments in the urban core, leading to increased supply. The meaningful new supply is driving below-average M-RevPAF growth expectations despite significant in-migration and job growth. Nashville also benefits from a leading health care industry; 17 publicly traded health care companies are headquartered in the city, which supports high-paying jobs and economic stability. One caution facing apartment demand is the high homeownership rate outside of the Downtown and Airport submarkets.  While a healthy supply pipeline and high homeownership rate pose some threats to apartment fundamentals, the stable health care industry and significant population growth provides investors with solid long-term growth potential.|A high-income and youthful population drives online sales; increasing demand for distribution spaces|Manufacturing demand driven by exposure to automotive manufacturers such as Nissan|The market has grown as a big box distribution hub over the past two decades, competing with other Southeast markets|Intermodal distribution network is weak compared to regional neighbors; hurts access to larger markets|Very low barriers to supply immediately outside the city|Demand for flex industrial poor; market better suited for manufacturing and warehouse space
6|195|Industrial|New York|New York: As the epicenter of the U.S. pandemic, New York faced steep job losses and deteriorating apartment fundamentals in the first half of ‘20. Finance remains the backbone of New York’s economy, and though not immune from layoffs, fared better than most industries in 1H’20. Growing tech interest in the city of late is a bright spot for apartment demand, with Facebook, Google, and Amazon all announcing large-scale expansions in ’19 (>20k jobs collectively). However, it remains to be seen if tech companies will modify pre-COVID plans following the acceleration in working from home. NYC would be a relative loser to lower-cost metros in a world where remote working becomes widely adopted. New York’s budget deficits worsened following the pandemic, and now require an estimated  ~600 bps increase to the median renter’s tax burden to cover the shortfall, which could accelerate recent outmigration. Asking rents fell precipitously in 1H’20 (~-10% YoY) and leasing activity was accompanied by a notable rise in concessions (~50% of new leases included concessions as of June ‘20). Just as investors began to wrap their heads around the expansive rent control laws passed in June ’19 by the state, transaction markets froze in 2Q’20 due to uncertainty surrounding asset prices, which have likely fallen double-digits.. A favorable supply outlook remains a silver lining for NYC, but apartment investors face significant headwinds in the coming years and a less-favorable long-term outlook in a post-COVID world. |Proximity to a dense, affluent population base|Limited development as high land cost and burdensome zoning restrictions help ensure supply-demand imbalance|Strong risk-adjusted returns supported by robust “last mile” demand over the long term|Aging infrastructure and inventory limits modern-day delivery technologies|Competition from better national shipping hubs (e.g., Lehigh Valley, Northern New Jersey)|Demand for modern, multi-story space still questionable, limited to select tenants thus far (e.g., Amazon, FedEx)
6|196|Industrial|Norfolk / Hampton Roads|Norfolk/Hampton Roads: The Norfolk / Hampton Roads market has experienced instability in recent years as the region’s reliance upon shipbuilding and government sector employment has taken a sizeable hit due to fiscal budget volatility and waning demand for shipbuilding. It is still unclear whether trade conflict with China will escalate and adversely affect market fundamentals. Steady growth in professional and business services has helped offset declines in government employment. Norfolk has the unique benefit of being a military town, as many military service members provide a foundation for the renter population. Local politicians have noted the need for increased retention of young adults to boost the regional economy and have spearheaded several initiatives to increase its cultural appeal. The efforts haven’t resulted in any major relocations, but the development of Ferguson’s new 8-story corporate HQ in Newport News, which was heavily subsidized by the city, provides anecdotal evidence that the government is ready and willing to sponsor local businesses. Retention of young adults will be critical to both the Norfolk / Hampton Roads economy as well as for renter demand. |Increasing trade volume through Port of Virginia|Limited spec supply this cycle|Strong leasing demand for Class A space|Uncertainty surrounding international trade conflicts|Shipbuilding industry struggling|Lack of economic diversification
6|197|Industrial|New Jersey (Northern)|New Jersey (Northern): Outsized job losses and subpar population growth pressure apartment fundamentals in Northern New Jersey. The metro serves as a cheaper alternative to Manhattan, especially in the urban Hudson County, but spillover demand from NYC has yet to translate into strong M-RevPAF growth. Several submarkets, including Hoboken and Jersey City, may begin to benefit from proximity to high-paying job growth across the river in Hudson Yards. The rise in work from home may accelerate this phenomenon, but it remains to be seen whether renters would rather flee NYC’s urban core for the cheaper NJ region, or instead opt to leave the NY-NJ area altogether given New Jersey’s dire fiscal health profile (~700bp tax increase required to cover the state’s unfunded liabilities). Future job forecasts remain underwhelming, but M-RevPAF growth should prove less sensitive to the economy in the near term. The expiration of the “Grow NJ” tax incentive program in ’19 dealt another blow to the region as the state has yet to find a replacement despite its moderate success in attracting relocations to the northern part of the state. Without tax incentives, Northern New Jersey will likely continue to shed jobs to more affordable metros, as companies are enticed by lower costs of business and faster-growing labor pools. Rent growth has lagged the top markets following elevated deliveries in ’17 and ’18, but the current supply pipeline should allow fundamentals to play catch-up in the intermediate term, resulting in a modest return profile.|Strong demographics in the market and nearby NYC provide robust ecommerce demand|Limited supply growth drives tight occupancies and high rents for Class A space|Top-notch intermodal network supports supply chain and last-mile delivery|Competes with cheaper, nearby markets (e.g., Central NJ, Philadelphia) for tenant demand|Aging inventory increases obsolescence risk in stock – difficult to incorporate leading-edge delivery technologies|Rising tax environment (e.g., gas tax increased ~250% since ’16) could hurt tenants’ margins
6|198|Industrial|Oakland-East Bay|Oakland-East Bay: While the East Bay has often been overlooked by institutional capital in past cycles, exceptionally low cap rates and softening fundamentals in neighboring Bay Area markets could shift additional interest to the relatively higher going-in yields in Oakland. Though still in the early innings, if the current work from home trend continues to accelerate, Oakland could be a relative winner as renters seek cheaper alternatives to San Francisco and Silicon Valley. Near-term growth forecasts reflect slightly stronger performance relative to its Bay Area peers as a result of these developing trends. Employer interest in Oakland has grown in recent years with multiple companies (e.g., Facebook and Microsoft) expressing interest in the area, a trend that should contribute to healthy population growth. In late ’19,  Facebook announced plans to increase their footprint in the market to upwards of ~1.3M SF of office space, which appears to be moving forward as planned. Increasingly strict California regulations and NIMBYism throughout the market keep the development pipeline lower than average. The Downtown submarket, however, should continue to see elevated deliveries in the near and intermediate term as a result of its proximity to public transit and its walkability, making it an appealing location for young renters and employees commuting into San Francisco. Though going-in yields remain low, healthy intermediate- and long-term NOI growth contribute to returns that rank among the top of the pack.  |Proximity to dense, affluent population bases in the greater Bay Area|Access to the Port of Oakland, the busiest port in Northern CA |Healthy income growth expected in the near -term|Eastern submarkets (e.g., Stockton and Modesto) struggle from weak demographics and interstate systems|Prop 15 (tax on commercial properties) failed in the November '20 election - likely to appear in subsequent elections|Limited supply barriers in Stockton and Modesto
6|201|Industrial|Orange County|Orange County: Healthy income growth and limited development have been the key drivers of Orange County’s improving apartment fundamentals in recent years. Job growth in Orange County has been mediocre of late, but the region enjoys a diversified workforce led by notable companies like Walt Disney, Boeing, and The Irvine Company. Because of the market’s housing costs, which are amongst the highest in the nation, residents are often forced to rent, creating a tailwind for apartment demand. California recently enacted a series of bills intended to address the state’s affordability issues, which may make it incrementally easier to develop apartments; however, multifamily permitting activity growth has consistently slowed over the last 3 years. In 2H’19, AB 1482 was enacted by Governor Newsom implementing statewide rent control for renewal offers on apartments that are older than 15 years. The law will be in effect beginning in January ’20 until January ‘30. Additionally, Prop 21, a measure to amend the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, will appear on the November ’20 ballot (a similar ballot measure failed in ’18), reigniting fear amongst landlords that local governments may be able to enact more restrictive forms of rent control.

With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, international travel has halted, damaging Orlando’s tourism-based economy and driving the unemployment rate to be among the worst of top markets in the early innings of the downturn. In recent years, Florida's business-friendly environment and the growth of the University of Central Florida have brought higher-wage jobs, such as professional services and health care, to the market, providing some insulation from Covid-19 fallout. Supply growth in Orlando is among the highest of top markets with the Southwest, South Central, and Maitland / Winter Park submarkets seeing the brunt of oncoming supply. Notable developments include downtown’s Creative Village, where UCF and Valencia’s shared campus opened in the summer of '19, bringing >7k students to downtown with long-term plans for ~15k students and >1.5k apartment units in the development. Despite supply growth concerns, investors should look to Maitland / Winter Park and South Central, particularly Thornton Park, for some of the market’s highest rents. Ultimately, investors should expect challenged near-term fundamentals as Orlando faces a tough recovery and struggles to absorb an elevated supply pipeline. In the long term, exceptional job and population growth create a healthy outlook for Orlando’s rent growth potential, though cap rates have compressed meaningfully in the market pre-Covid-19, tempering long-term return potential. |$4.3B airport expansion to finish in ’22, and $2.3B effort to upgrade I-4 will be complete by ’21|Robust population and job growth to drive ecommerce demand and demand for warehouse space|In ’20, Amazon absorbed ~2.2M SF of industrial space in Orlando, compared to 2.1M SF from ’14-’19|Availability and affordability of land increases risk of oversupply|Faces regional competition from nearby, more affordable Lake County|Reliance on tourism creates volatility and has led to increased unemployment
6|203|Industrial|Palm Beach|Palm Beach: With population growth forecasts that best its South Florida peers and many top markets, Palm Beach is gradually evolving from a sleepy retirement town to an up-and-coming metro. Attracted to the market’s amenities, affordability, and low taxes, financial and business services companies have relocated to the metro while the hospitality and health care industries have also seen consistent growth. Virgin Trains USA now connects Palm Beach to Miami and will connect Palm Beach to Orlando in coming years. Supply growth, centered in the West Palm Beach, Lake Worth, and Boca Raton submarkets remains elevated, but has moderated after a spike in ‘17. Investors should look to the Boca Raton East submarket, which stands out for having the most educated population and the highest rents in the metro. Strong growth forecasts and a desirable lifestyle bode well for Palm Beach, ranking it above most top markets in terms of long-term rent growth potential and near-term M-RevPAF growth expectations. 	|Brightline connects Palm Beach to the rest of South Florida and will connect the metro to Orlando in ’21|Proximity to Port Everglades and PortMiami, together undergoing ~$2B of improvements over the next 5 years|Amazon expanding their presence in metro with a 1M SF fulfillment center to open in ’21|More susceptible to oversupply than South Florida peers|High cap-ex reserves due to hurricane risk|Localized industrial market with demand primarily driven by small-to-mid sized (~30-50k SF) warehouse users
6|204|Industrial|Philadelphia|Philadelphia: Philadelphia’s affordability versus other major East Coast markets (e.g., New York, D.C.) is a draw for some renters, but underwhelming job growth expectations sets the stage for below-average apartment fundamentals. The region’s large education and health care presence (e.g., University of Pennsylvania, Jefferson Healthcare system) provides stable employment, and a rapidly-growing life sciences industry has been a bright spot in Philly’s otherwise tepid economy, attracting strong venture capital inflows to the city (~$2.5B in ’19). The influx of tech funding paired with an abundance of local research facilities is expected to drive above-average income growth. The city’s punitive tax structure and unfriendly business environment largely limits major corporate relocations to the metro, and most cities that do set up shop choose to do so in the suburbs where taxes are less onerous. As such, there is a disconnect between where typical apartment renters live (CBD) and where the job growth is concentrated (suburbs). Investments in the city center and a drastically reduced crime rate have improved the city’s ability in retaining young talent (25-34 age cohort population growth has outpaced the overall average), but total population trends still prove worrisome. Philly’s capital flows are better than the city’s historic record, driven by smaller investors expanding outside of the surrounding metros in search of higher going-in yields.|Lehigh Valley has proven to be a strong alternative for distribution to NYC region|Affluent submarkets drive strong tenant demand; should persist as ecommerce adoption grows|Amazon continues regional expansion highlighted by >1M SF development in Gloucester County expected to complete in ‘21|Supply growth risk is higher, especially in Central Pennsylvania|Aging stock could incite further development, especially closer to Philadelphia|Competition from nearby metros that can also serve Northeast population base (Central NJ, Baltimore) 
6|205|Industrial|Phoenix|Phoenix: Phoenix apartment fundamentals are bolstered by top-ranked job and population growth expectations. As a low-cost alternative to major California markets, Phoenix continues to draw residents from its neighbors to the west. Infosys, an IT services company, will move into the newly-delivered Novus Innovation Corridor in the North Tempe submarket once offices are able to reopen and intend to bring ~1k jobs to Phoenix by ’23. As additional companies are attracted to Tempe, apartment demand in the North and South Tempe submarkets should increase due to the walkable, urban amenities, and access to various transit alternatives. The Roosevelt Row (RoRo) neighborhood in the Downtown submarket is an up-and-coming neighborhood that is growing in popularity. Demand in Phoenix is expected to continue outpacing the high levels of supply for now, leading to relatively high levels of near-term M-RevPAF growth. Over longer periods of time, supply will likely catch up with demand, resulting in average long-term growth prospects. |As a Foreign-Trade Zone, companies can defer, reduce, or eliminate duty costs for exports and reduce property taxes|SkyBridge at the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport will expedite the customs process and further facilitate trade with Mexico|Top ranked population growth forecasts fuel further growth in ecommerce demand|Low barriers to entry; near-term supply growth is heavily concentrated in Southwest and Goodyear submarkets|Long distances to seaports and weak rail system|Long-term return potential is limited by middle-of-the-pack cap rates and long-term NOI growth
6|206|Industrial|Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh: Investors should exhibit cautious optimism when considering the “Steel City’s” apartment sector. While the Pittsburgh economy lags nearby East Coast metros due to its dependence on low-growth industries, a strong university system supports the nascent tech industry that is slowly gaining traction in the metro. Though employers like Apple, Facebook, and Google recruit from these universities that specialize in artificial intelligence, life sciences, and robotics projects, overall employment growth in other sectors remains poor and Pittsburgh’s tech scene is still growing off a low base. Much of the development and transactions in the apartment sector occur in the CBD and Oakland / East End submarkets. Here, investors find the highest rent growth potential while still yielding attractive going-in cap rates. These submarkets are changing from aging industrial buildings to new office and apartment developments. The $273M “3 Crossings” master plan is set to build 2 apartment buildings with ~300 units by ‘21, among other developments. Despite these emerging positive trends, caution should be exhibited as the metro battles high millennial out-migration rates as graduates from the metro’s elite university systems look toward more desirable markets for employment. Additionally, rent growth is limited by the metro’s lack of supply constraints and inexpensive home prices, which drive high homeownership rates. Pittsburgh displays one of the highest economic cap rates in the nation, but worrying long-term growth prospects deserve a watchful eye.|Proximity to both East Coast and Midwest markets with access to interstate routes|Growing ecommerce adoption in affluent submarkets supports warehouse demand|Heavy dependence on manufacturing provides floor for demand|Aging inventory poses obsolescence risk, higher cap-ex requirements, and lower pricing power|Low population density and increasing out-migration|Below-average household income levels equates to less online spending and therefore less last-mile demand
6|207|Industrial|Portland|Portland: Portland’s apartment fundamentals are driven by solid job and population growth among young adults looking for relative affordability and a high quality of life. The significant in-migration has resulted in robust rent growth over the last few years; however, developers have quickly caught on. Completions in ’19 reached an all-time high and while fewer new starts are now expected because of Covid-19, projects still in the pipeline will likely outpace demand in the coming years. Portland’s decision to enact statewide rent control has garnered national attention, and while the long-term impact of the new law remains unknown, it is expected to have a minimal effect on short-term apartment fundamentals since the 7+% inflation rent cap is far above rent growth projections. The concern lies within whether it will lead to tighter limits down the road that would negatively impact investors' ability to increase rents, hurting overall returns. A recently-passed measure that requires cities with >25,000 people to allow duplexes, triplexes, and quadplexes in areas zoned for single-family suggest already-low barriers to supply will ease further.	|The positive effects of in-migration and steady job growth helps provide a buoyant near-and long-term growth outlook|The large millennial population, well-above the top market average, bolsters ecommerce demand within the metro|It is well-located between two highly populated metros (Bay Area, Seattle), supporting additional warehouse demand|U.S. trade conflicts with China might impact demand; Oregon’s exports to China are among the highest in the U.S.|Fewer barriers to supply relative to West Coast peers might lead to more speculative development|Continued cap rate compression in the city will likely limit risk-adjusted return expectations
6|209|Industrial|Raleigh-Durham|Raleigh-Durham: Raleigh’s demographic profile has improved meaningfully after benefiting from exceptional employment growth over the last cycle and experiencing an influx of younger age cohorts. The recent demographic trends are expected to continue with near-term employment growth forecasted to be amongst the strongest of our top markets. Proximity to top universities, affordable living costs, and desirable submarkets are some of the key factors behind Raleigh’s strong population growth and domestic in-migration trends. As a result of strengthening demographics, M-RevPAF growth forecasts are expected to outperform most of our top markets. Raleigh’s booming apartment demand, however, has not been overlooked by local developers, and with low barriers to development, supply growth should continue to restrain rent growth over the next few years. One notable project contributing to the elevated supply pipeline in ’20 and ’21 includes Midtown Exchange, a $1B mixed-use project that will include ~1,300 new apartment units. Strong long-term growth forecasts offset low going-in yields following cap rate compression in recent years, resulting in solid return expectations. |Advanced manufacturing serves as a demand tailwind – warehouse job expansion led top markets in ‘20|Favorable 500-mile population radius, particularly in Northern Durham|Use of flex space and proximity to airport / rail system give Cary and RTP efficiency advantages|Weak supply barriers, particularly in East Raleigh with Moffat Properties developing ~450k SF of flex space through ‘21|Unfavorable population density in East Raleigh and South Wake County hamper last mile delivery|Space catered toward tech and life science presence has increased cap-ex maintenance requirements
6|210|Industrial|Richmond|Richmond: A relatively affordable lifestyle and decent Fortune 500 presence drive apartment demand in Richmond, including headquarters for notable companies such as Altria and Carmax. The local economy relies heavily on business services and government jobs. Despite the region’s favorable cost of business, job growth has lagged behind the top market average consistently since mid-’16 (though the trend  somewhat reversed in 1H’20). The departure of Building Commissioner Douglas Murrow in ’18, whose stringent policies and slow-moving approval procedures were a source of headaches for local developers, has already increased the ease of real estate construction and led to a record-high development pipeline. Approval of ~$3M in tax breaks for Lynx Venture’s proposed 165-unit building in the Downtown / The Fan submarket is emblematic of the city’s new pro-development policies. Revitalization efforts in the Scott’s Addition neighborhood and the Downtown / The Fan submarkets has attracted an influx of millennials. An attractive going-in yield slightly offset by below-average long-term NOI growth expectations results in a solid return profile for apartment investors.|Notable chemical manufacturing presence drives demand|Port of Richmond is one of the largest inland distribution ports on the East Coast |Low cost of business and ease of distribution attracts ecommerce tenants |One of the lowest population densities of all top markets imposes a ceiling on demand|Low supply barriers support over 4.4M SF in the development pipeline, placing downward pressure on pricing power|Competition from nearby Norfolk, Northern Virginia, and Washington D.C. 
6|212|Industrial|Sacramento|Sacramento: Fundamentals in Sacramento appear to be holding up nicely, with near-term M-RevPAF growth forecasted to outpace most top markets. As the Golden State capital, Sacramento benefits from strong and resilient employment in the public sector which has contributed to steady income growth over the last several years. The University submarket is likely to outperform others in Sacramento over the long term due to a denser population base and large presence of a younger renting cohort. As NIMBYism remains a significant impediment and lower rents make developments difficult to pencil, the supply pipeline is forecasted to remain relatively low. Though Sacramento struggles to compete with San Francisco and Silicon Valley for prominent tech interest, accelerating work from home trends could drive renter demand as employees are able to live further from their jobs and enjoy cheaper rents and  larger spaces. This trend has yet to fully play out and has room to run, thus long-term rent expectations in the market remain in line with the top markets. With high going-in yields relative to other California markets and healthy growth expectations, Sacramento boasts among the highest expected returns across the top markets. |Above-average population growth trends signal further growth in ecommerce demand |High going-in yields coupled with strong long-term growth prospects drive attractive return expectations|The crossroads of 4 major freeways makes for efficient distribution|Availability of land weakens barriers to supply; new supply is concentrated in the Natomas submarket|Competes with Bay Area submarkets for tenants (e.g., Stockton)|Above-average age of existing stock with a growing share of obsolete inventory
6|213|Industrial|Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City: Salt Lake City’s economy continues to diversify as companies from various sectors are drawn to the metro’s business-friendly environment and deep talent pool. A large portion of the market’s strong population growth is concentrated among younger age groups who are attracted to the lifestyle and job market, fueling demand for apartments in the CBD submarket due to the close proximity to many offices and the relatively urban, walkable location. Developers have responded to this demand with the construction of notable developments including The Block 67 project and The Exchange, which will add a combined ~1k units by ‘21. Many of these luxury apartments are highly amenitized developments targeting millennials and new residents, but ~80 apartments in The Exchange will be left for affordable housing. Developers will be able to keep the vast majority of units at market rates, though, as the Utah government did not pass a bill to give cities the choice to impose rent control in 1Q’20. The flood of supply in the market has dampened what would have been otherwise robust fundamentals the last three years, but favorable demand should be more than enough to absorb units that deliver over the next few years. Long-term NOI growth is aided by solid fiscal health and the metro’s relative desirability, and a high initial yield combined with a favorable growth outlook make for attractive potential long-term returns. |Expanding technology and finance presence is driving high income growth|Significant in-migration from younger demographics due to strong job market and affordability |Strong fiscal health limits income and property tax pressure seen in other metros|Homeownership is encouraged by market’s affordability|Limited barriers to supply hurt an already sprawling market|Low school rating decreases attractiveness for families migrating to the area
6|214|Industrial|San Antonio|San Antonio: Despite recent positive demand trends, the San Antonio apartment sector continues to face fundamental pressure stemming from the region’s housing affordability and lack of supply barriers. The metro has been a beneficiary of the fracking boom which has increased job and population growth, and it has also seen an increase in higher paying health care jobs; significant investment has been made to improve / expand health care facilities. Four large military bases provide stability and promote economic activity. Current rent and occupancy remain depressed from a large wave of new deliveries that hit the market in ’16 and ’17 during the energy recession, but stable demand supported by its exposure to the military has caused near-term M-RevPAF growth forecasts to be among the best of the top markets. Supply pipelines remain large in the near-term, while longer term, low barriers to entry, low levels of human capital, and large pockets of crime / poverty contribute to San Antonio’s mediocre long-term NOI growth prospects. The northern submarkets are better positioned than their southern counterparts, with the Northeast submarket standing out as a cut above the rest given its superior demographics. In aggregate, San Antonio screens middle-of-the-pack as compared with the rest of the top apartment markets regarding return expectations.|Benefiting from spillover demand from Austin |Port San Antonio provides access to industrial airport and railport|Northwest submarket’s high population density drives demand for last-mile delivery locations|Flight to quality as older stock retains more of market’s vacancy share|Speculative delivery volume pressuring occupancy levels|Suppressed M-RevPAF growth expectations compared to top market average
6|215|Industrial|Inland Empire|Inland Empire: With rental rates and home prices in Los Angeles and Orange County among the highest in the nation, many have turned to the neighboring Inland Empire as a cheaper housing alternative which has resulted in strengthening apartment fundamentals for the metro. The region’s position as a prominent west coast logistics hub has created thousands of new jobs—resulting in above-average population growth—and continues to drive decent housing demand. Chino and Corona, the closest submarkets to LA and OC, have seen the strongest renter demand due to above-average income levels and rising home prices. Given a severe housing shortage and overall lack of affordability, in 2H’19 AB 1482 was enacted by Governor Newsom implementing statewide rent control for renewal offers on apartments that are older than 15 years. The law will be in effect from January ’20 through January ‘30. Additionally, Prop 21, a measure to amend the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, will appear on the November ’20 ballot (a similar ballot measure failed in ’18), reigniting fear amongst landlords that local governments may be able to enact more restrictive forms of rent control. On the supply front, development has been dormant for much of this cycle, with most new deliveries being garden-style multifamily units. Single-family affordability and low-wage job growth relative to other Southern California metros will be among the largest long-term headwinds for apartment owners versus most West Coast markets.|Proximity to vital transportation nodes (e.g., LAX and Ontario airports, and the LA / Long Beach Port Complex)|Can easily serve Southern California population from Santa Barbara to San Diego|Major ecommerce hub, Amazon occupies 14 fulfillment centers in the market |Land availability is shrinking, but still accessible vs. rest of Southern California |Competes with other Southwestern U.S. markets (Las Vegas, Phoenix, Reno)|Major freeways becoming significantly more congested 
6|216|Industrial|San Diego|San Diego: San Diego is consistently recognized as one of the most desirable places to live in the U.S. because of its pleasant climate, healthy demographics, and 70 miles of picturesque coastline. Fundamentals are supported by the strong university network that retains ~50% of students as full-time residents post-graduation, and home prices that remain unaffordable for recent graduates and most young families. The market is home to an array of headquarters including Sempra Energy and Qualcomm, along with a variety of employers that are drawn to San Diego’s talented workforce. New, highly amenitized supply growth is concentrated in the Downtown submarket, which has the lowest homeownership rate in San Diego at ~20%. San Diego has high supply constraints due to natural and legislative barriers. In Downtown San Diego, developers must comply with a 500-ft cap on buildings because of its close proximity to the airport. In 2H’19, AB 1482 was enacted by Governor Newsom implementing statewide rent control for renewal offers on apartments that are older than 15 years. The law will be in effect beginning January ’20 until January ‘30. Additionally, Prop 21, a measure to amend the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act will appear on the November ’20 ballot (a similar ballot measure failed in ’18), reigniting fear among landlords that local governments may be able to enact more restrictive forms of rent control. |Land availability is limited throughout most of the market|Affluent population base receptive to ecommerce demand|Access points via air, land, and sea|Strong competition from other Southern California markets, especially Inland Empire|Local distributors rely on LA County ports, bypass San Diego|Slow job growth forecasts through ’25 in industrial using sectors such as manufacturing
6|217|Industrial|San Francisco|San Francisco: As a top tech hub with exceptionally high income levels, stable employment forecasts and one of the most educated population bases in the country, San Francisco remains among the most expensive places to rent. San Francisco continues to be one of the most difficult cities to build in, with NIMBYism, as well as geographic and regulatory barriers to development, impeding new supply. Political risk remains significant in the market as California, especially as leaders in Los Angeles and San Francisco, continue to tilt more populist and implement new legislation accordingly. Though Prop 10 (repeal of Costa-Hawkins Act, which limits the scope of rent control) lost in ‘18, the passage of AB 1482 in the state of California (limits annual rent increases to 5%),  took effect in early ’20. Similar campaigns are likely to pop up over the next several years with the most notable one being another potential repeal of Costa-Hawkins revisiting the ballot in November ‘20. Despite developing legislative headwinds, San Francisco’s long-term rent growth is likely to outperform most top markets largely as a result of the regulatory constraints and strong human capital. Further, homeownership in the Bay Area remains out of reach for many, especially in San Francisco, where the median home price reaches >$1M. It is worth noting that as work from home trends accelerate and companies (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) formulate plans for at least a portion of employees to permanently work remote, San Francisco’s high exposure to the tech industry may become a growing concern. Though going-in yields are low, elevated long-term NOI growth projections boost San Francisco toward the top of our return expectations across the  top markets. |Dense and wealthy population base likely to be significant consumers of ecommerce|High geographic and legislative supply barriers remain intact|Quick access to an international airport|Strong competition from local Bay Area peers with more diverse industrial footprints|Weak interstate connectivity and traffic congestion remain concerns|Aging and obsolescent stock could cause tenants to look elsewhere 
6|218|Industrial|San Jose|San Jose: Big tech firms and their educated and well-compensated workforce drove much of the success in the South Bay market over the last cycle. In late ‘19, Facebook and Google announced plans to expand their presences by a combined ~8M SF in San Jose, creating space for an additional ~35k employees in the market. With multiple companies, including Facebook, expressing plans to shift a portion of employees to remote work solutions permanently, it remains unclear what portion of these jobs will be in the office full time as the secular shift to working from home continues to play out. In an attempt to improve the Bay Area housing crisis, Facebook, Google, and Apple have each pledged $1B to build additional housing and keep further home price appreciation at bay. Additional infrastructure projects include the ~$5.5B Silicon Valley BART expansion which will connect Oakland to San Jose and allow the workforce to travel between the metros more easily. Though affordable housing initiatives have become seemingly ubiquitous across California, favorable regulatory barriers remain in place, limiting future market rate supply growth. . While San Jose had been a relative winner of migration trends throughout much of the last cycle, near-term population growth forecasts appear to be in line with our top market average stemming from uncertainty related to the work from home shift. Though going-in yields remain low, and near-term growth prospects are stunted, strong long-term growth forecasts contribute to healthy return expectations.|Dense and wealthy population base likely to be significant consumers of ecommerce|Geographic and regulatory barriers discourage new supply|R&D space in high demand as the technology industry continues to drive the market|Rising housing costs price many warehouse employees out of the market|Weak interstate system limits easy connectivity to neighboring markets|Aging and obsolete stock could cause tenants to look elsewhere
6|219|Industrial|Seattle|Seattle: The prominence of giant tech firms, including Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, continue to drive high-paying job growth to the region. Apartment fundamentals have greatly benefited from the rapid expansion of these tech companies as they compete for top talent in the metro. Just within the past year, Apple, Amazon, and Expedia have added a combined ~6,000 jobs to Seattle, primarily concentrated in the South Lake Union and Bellevue submarkets. Institutional capital interest in the region has ramped— and with it came a wave of new development. The South Lake Union, Bellevue, and Central submarkets, Seattle’s most expensive areas, are seeing the highest new supply, likely causing rent growth to slow as developments are completed. In addition, legislation was passed in ‘19 that will lower barriers to supply in several submarkets. Microsoft announced plans to invest $500M to provide affordable housing in the Kirkland, Bellevue, and Federal Way submarkets. Individuals looking for rent relief from Seattle’s most expensive areas are fueling new demand and boosting fundamentals in the submarkets of Everett, Kent, and Federal Way. Despite weakening demand from the impacts of the pandemic, Seattle’s long-term growth and return expectations are among the best relative to other coastal markets.  |Amazon’s growth has boosted overall regional prosperity and consumption |The market has become significantly land constrained, especially between Seattle and Tacoma|Business environment generally more favorable than other West Coast markets|The Northwest Seaport Alliance, a key industrial demand driver, may be challenged due to trade tensions|Near-term supply is a modest risk, higher than recent quarters|Uncertainty surrounding the aerospace manufacturing sector; large reliance on Boeing in some areas of Seattle
6|220|Industrial|St. Louis|St. Louis: Fundamentals in St. Louis remain uninspiring as the market’s high exposure to low-growth sectors, such as manufacturing and trade, have rendered the local economy a laggard in terms of GDP and employment growth relative to other Midwest markets. While supply barriers remain low with few regulatory or geographic constraints, low growth and minimal demand have kept new development at bay. Given the market’s poor performance amidst a tepid supply pipeline, this trend is worrisome for local owners. Employment growth, which had been sluggish throughout most of the last cycle, will likely prove even more troublesome as employment trends are expected to slow amid the ongoing recession. A bright spot for the region has been Boeing and GM’s continued investment in the market; Boeing’s regional workforce has expanded by 2k jobs over the last couple years and GM recently invested $1.5B into their Wentzville truck factory. It remains to be seen how Boeing’s ongoing 737 troubles, further exacerbated by the current pandemic which has significantly reduced travel demand, will impact local hiring. Further headwinds for the St. Louis apartment market include an aging and stagnant population base as well as very affordable single-family homes. Relatively high going-in yields offset weak intermediate and long-term growth forecasts which results in a return profile that is expected to be in line with our top market average.|“Gateway to the West” has good access to rail and interstate network, especially I-70|Third party logistics demand is usually healthy, buffering vacancies|Local environment promotes business through tax credits and enterprise zones|Large supply pipeline in St. Charles submarket (~48% of new stock)|Poor access to seaports makes distribution largely transitory|St. Louis will lag national GDP growth by ~10% over the next 5 years limiting local demand
6|225|Industrial|Tampa-St. Petersburg|Tampa-St. Petersburg: Tampa’s strong population growth is largely driven by retirees, which tempers otherwise bright fundamentals. Law firm Baker McKenzie will open an innovation hub that will bring ~300 jobs to the Central Tampa submarket, and the health and life science research presence around the Moffitt Cancer Center continues to grow with Swedish biotech company Vycellix choosing Tampa for its U.S HQ. Supply growth in Tampa surpasses the top market average with new deliveries centered in the Central Tampa and Central St. Petersburg submarkets. In Central Tampa, investors should be wary of Midtown Tampa and Water Street, 2 mixed-use developments currently under construction that will bring ~1.7k units to the submarket. While traditionally a favorite for its healthy demographics, the Southwest Tampa submarket is also facing more supply. The Westshore Marina District has started construction and will add >1k apartments and condos, retail space, and a marina to the Southwest submarket. With an economy driven by local services and overall less sensitive to Covid-19 risk, Tampa is expected to perform well over the next 5 years, resulting in above-average M-RevPAF growth expectations. Over the long term, Tampa’s population growth and status as a desirable coastal market mitigate the effects of oversupply to support healthy long-term NOI growth for Tampa apartments.|Port Manatee serves as central vessel for southeast commerce; large increase in trade activity in ‘20|Ecommerce demand has been strong among landowners, particularly along Interstate 4 corridor|Investment in traffic infrastructure in Tampa CBD and St. Petersburg has improved operational performance|Outdated inventory in the Mid-Pinellas near the St. Pete-Clearwater Airport hampers delivery efficiencies|Supply expected to pick up with ~2.1M SF of speculative space in the pipeline|Lower relative long-term ceiling for ecommerce adoption, given Tampa’s demographic backdrop
6|1264|Industrial|Honolulu|Honolulu: As one of the world’s top tourist destinations, the Honolulu economy primarily relies on the leisure and hospitality sectors which have faced large recent headwinds due to Covid-19. The island’s isolated location and high-cost environment make it difficult for businesses to justify moving into the market, leading to limited employment growth in other sectors. The ever-rising cost of living has led to population declines in recent years, and much of the loss has been concentrated in the 34-and-below age group. Despite these negative tailwinds, limited supply insulates apartment fundamentals on the island. The strict entitlement and permitting processes, along with high land prices, make development time consuming and pricey. To make up for affordability issues on the island, the local government is working to ease supply barriers. Recent legislation (Bill 7) was approved in ‘19 in hopes of encouraging the development of more affordable housing for Honolulu residents. The new law allows higher density apartments to be built on lots of <20k SF in exchange for requirements to charge rates deemed affordable on at least 80% of the units. Douglas Emmett is also in the process of converting a ~490k SF office building into ~500 apartment units over the next few years in the Central Honolulu submarket. An unclear outlook for the Honolulu economy, out-migration, and easing supply barriers call for intermediate-term growth to remain among the lowest of the top markets, hindering the island’s risk-adjusted return expectations. |NIMBYism further limits supply growth in the market|Kakaako and Kalihi / Airport submarket fundamentals are bolstered by the Honolulu Harbor and dense populations|Honolulu serves as the hub for imports to Hawaii due to its central location among the islands|3-7 day shipping versus the race to same day delivery on the mainland limits ecommerce penetration|The island’s stock is among the oldest of the top markets; growing share of obsolete inventory|Not a national distribution hub; fundamentals have a heavier reliance on the local economy
6|1282|Industrial|Columbus|Columbus: While the capital of Ohio is economically outperforming its Midwest peers, decelerating job growth in the FIRE and TAMI sectors coupled with a lack of supply barriers limit long-term prospects for Columbus. The city’s strengths lie in the large presence of Fortune 500 companies that have helped attract young talent and greatly contributed to the metro’s economic growth. Ohio State University, one of the largest universities in the U.S., also provides a strong base of educated professionals (~40% of graduates stay in Columbus). Developers have been actively adding new supply to the metro as strong in-migration and business expansions have increased apartment demand. Most of the new supply is concentrated in the University / Downtown submarket, where demand for mixed-use space has accelerated. If job growth continues to meaningfully decline in high-paying industries, the significant supply pipeline may dampen future apartment fundamentals, especially as the long-term effects of Covid-19 are felt. Investors should also be wary of affordable single-family housing placing a cap on rent growth. Overall, Columbus’ educated workforce and millennial population are helping apartment demand, but low barriers to entry limit long-term NOI growth and return expectations.	|Business-friendly / low tax environment has attracted employers and industrial users|The Rickenbacker cargo airport and a central location allows for ease of distribution throughout the United States|Relatively low supply growth projections over the intermediate term|Strong competition from other Midwest markets threatens demand|Aggressive tax abatements for new developments hinder long-term NOI growth for new assets|Obsolescence factor is higher than other markets due to steady volume of development
6|1316|Industrial|Dallas / Fort Worth|Dallas / Fort Worth: The sprawling DFW metro has many strong demand drivers but is still susceptible to large waves of new supply. DFW continues to be an attractive business destination as employers are drawn to the region’s business-friendly environment, affordability, and centralized location, and the quality of job growth has improved in recent years with higher paying finance and tech job growth gaining momentum.  Low physical and regulatory barriers to entry have resulted in inflated supply pipelines and a deluge of new deliveries. These units are being matched with robust demand, resulting in average intermediate-term M-RevPAF growth forecasts. Long-term NOI growth is negatively impacted by the ease with which new supply can be added to the market. A significant portion of new supply is focused in the northern neighborhoods of Plano / Frisco and in the University Park submarket.

Metro apartment fundamentals have lagged most major markets this cycle, though prospects are improving in the near term, the stability of public sector hiring should lead to a shallower trough in apartment rents and occupancy versus other coastal markets. Over the intermediate term, a highly-educated labor force and positive momentum on the TAMI job growth front bode well for apartment fundamentals. Amazon’s move to Crystal City will likely prove a win for local apartment owners as the firm will attract an influx of highly compensated employees. The new jobs associated with HQ2, which in total represent a 10% expansion of tech jobs for the market, are likely to be phased in over the course of ~10 years. Along with Crystal City, the Southwest Waterfront and Nationals Park neighborhoods continue to be hotbeds for new Class A product. Supply growth is expected to remain steady over the coming years, preventing a meaningful re-acceleration in rent growth (similar to most markets). As the pandemic exacerbates many large state and city deficits that will likely require significant tax hikes to resolve (e.g., NYC and NJ), D.C. stands to benefit as one of the few gateway markets not burdened by poor fiscal health. Uncertainty around government spending may continue to be a headwind for the area, but the D.C.

7|150|Mall|Atlanta|Atlanta: Atlanta’s pro-business environment continues to attract companies and drive steady job growth within the metro. In 3Q'19, BlackRock announced that its new innovation center will bring >1k tech jobs to the Northeast submarket, beginning in ’20. Google expanded its presence in Midtown in 4Q'19 while Microsoft announced its new Atlanta office, which will bring ~1.5k jobs to Midtown, in 2Q’20. The Midtown submarket, offering a walkable lifestyle adjacent to Georgia Tech, has garnered significant attention from developers with ~2k apartment units under construction. While overall supply growth in Atlanta is in line with the top market average, the Gwinnet submarket has seen outsized development. Cumberland and Buckhead remain favorable due to their relatively muted supply pipelines and strong demographics; Buckhead continues to attract millennials with its walkability, strong transport systems, and cultural amenities while residents seeking suburban living flock to the Cumberland submarket, located only 20 minutes from Downtown. Traffic congestion and poor infrastructure are still problematic across the metro, although the city and state plan to invest $2.5B to improve MARTA lines and offerings over the next 25 years. With healthy employment growth and an increasing tech presence, Atlanta boasts a strong long-term outlook and near-term M-RevPAF growth that bests most top markets.|Strong retail sales growth forecast through ’25, supported by favorable population growth|Household income is expected to grow faster than top market average, aided by TAMI growth|Infrastructure development in the metro increases retail accessibility through direct connection with MARTA stations|High supply per capita within the market and average mall grades bode poorly for sales productivity|Growing supply in Midtown, with historic industrial neighborhood dropping ~32.5k SF of retail space in ‘21|Weak occupancy levels as mall supply per capita and sales productivity screen worse than Sun Belt comparable markets
7|151|Mall|Austin|Austin: Strong asset value appreciation for Austin apartments has been driven by robust demand from both employment and population growth. Austin has become a major tech hub and destination for skilled, young workers that is fueled by a deep talent pool from local universities, a vibrant culture, and relative affordability. Upcoming expansion plans by brand-name employers bode well for job growth momentum. Apple’s $1 billion campus development  will bring 15k new jobs in the area by ’22. Facebook, Google, and Oracle, and now Tesla are also expanding their presence in the metro. This population boom has caused once-affordable home prices to surge, giving apartment owners more room to push rents. Rental demand anchored by the millennial cohort has been focused in the Downtown / Northwest submarkets, and the area around The Domain. New development has also been concentrated in these areas. The supply pipeline remains elevated, but demand is expected to allow for above-average M-RevPAF growth. Barriers to entry in Austin, while less than coastal markets, are the highest in Texas which will help support long-term rent growth. There is also growing evidence of NIMBYism in the area as residents and the city council have expressed concerns over increased traffic and rapidly rising home prices. Strong fundamentals, coupled with relatively attractive cap rates compared to markets with similar growth, drive attractive risk-adjusted returns.|Above average household income which boosts spending power|Market leading population and job growth led by a younger demographic|Above-average retail sales growth expectations driven by in-migration trends and a favorable supply landscape.|A high-quality and competitive retail market which may result in outsized capex burdens.|Cost of living increasing faster than the average market in the top 50|Strong population growth led by younger demographic may shift consumer spending habits (i.e. ecommerce)
7|152|Mall|Baltimore|The Baltimore market remains an intriguing option for investors shying away from the increasingly modest going-in yields presented by other East Coast markets. Fueled by growth in the information and professional services sectors, future economic growth in Baltimore is likely to outpace that of many of its Eastern seaboard peers. Notably, a strengthening high-tech sector largely comprised of cybersecurity firms continues to spill over from the neighboring D.C. Metro, bolstered by a highly skilled local workforce and the presence of major universities such as Johns Hopkins and the University of Maryland. Various suburbs intend to reap the benefits of this wave of cybersecurity growth; the Merriweather District development hopes to create a “center of gravity in the cyberspace community” while transforming the landscape of downtown Columbia. Such development is not limited to suburbs, however, as the massive Port Covington project seeks to breathe new life into Baltimore City. Despite such efforts over the long term, current headwinds include high crime rates and severely entrenched urban poverty, rendering Baltimore City a less attractive region in which to live and work. Higher cap rates may attract some yield-oriented investors, but poor intermediate-term growth and a fairly restrained long-term outlook should be a drag on returns. |High household incomes in Annapolis / Crofton and Columbia submarkets contribute to strong TAP Scores|Low cost of living increases disposable income|Below-average mall supply per capita |Only 39% of mall stock is ‘A-’ quality or better; outsized obsolescence risk weighs on property values|Below-average population and income growth expectations prevent meaningful improvement of consumer balance sheets |Below-average occupancy levels signaling weaker retailer profiles 
7|154|Mall|Boston|Boston: The market continues to attract an outsized share of knowledge-based workers as employers are drawn to a well-educated population anchored by a top university system. Employers like Amazon, Foundation Medicine, Klaviyo, and Google are expanding in or relocating to Boston, bringing thousands of high-paying jobs to the metro. Millennial population continues to grow as recent graduates chase these high-paying jobs. In addition to in-migration, apartment demand is supported by some of the highest home prices across top markets, delaying homeownership for many renters. A healthy demand backdrop combined with an average supply pipeline will help the city overcome short-term struggles brought on by the pandemic, leaving Boston among the strongest gateway markets for intermediate growth potential. Healthy demand can be found in Boston’s downtown submarkets given a desirable lifestyle and proximity to work. Investors should be aware of the “Imagine Boston 2030” master plan and its aim to make the market more affordable by ‘30 through increased mixed-use development which will add apartment inventory to the metro.

7|156|Mall|New Jersey (Central)|New Jersey (Central): The Central New Jersey apartment market has proven a stable but low-growth market this past cycle. The long-term outlook remains underwhelming due to concerning fiscal health trends and sluggish employer growth. The state’s “Grow NJ” program, which provided tax incentives for companies that created or retained jobs in the region, had little success in Central New Jersey and finally expired in July ’19. The state’s concerning fiscal health (debt burden >$200B), which will likely be much worse following Covid-19, should deter investors as property tax increases to raise government funds would cut directly into the bottom line. Green Street estimates that a ~700 bp increase to the median resident’s non-federal tax burden is required to offset the state’s unfunded liabilities, which translates to an ~8% decline in after-tax income. Princeton University’s younger demographic provides steady rental demand for landlords in the Mercer / Princeton submarket, but the metro struggles to keep graduates from relocating to surrounding metros with better job prospects (e.g., New York, D.C., Boston). Stagnant population growth has pressured investors’ ability to push rents, and millennial out-migration forecasts will likely continue to weigh on long-term demand.|High spending power PSF; affluent population|Above average occupancy levels, signaling stronger retailer health|Job losses due to Covid lower than most Northeastern peers; lower unemployment rate|Below-average job growth forecasts; tepid population growth|Over-retailed market; lower grade malls should struggle in post-covid retail recovery|Concerning fiscal health may lead to tax hikes
7|158|Mall|Charlotte|Charlotte: Strong domestic in-migration and employment growth have provided nice tailwinds for apartment fundamentals. Young adults have flocked to North Carolina’s most populous metro, drawn by Charlotte’s diverse range of employment opportunities, relative affordability compared to other East Coast hubs, and a dynamic live / work / play environment. The quality of job growth has improved in recent years, fueled by the array of employers that operate in Charlotte and those that are choosing to expand in the market (e.g., Lowe’s, U.S. Bank, Honeywell). Developers have been active and there has been a focus on mixed-use development along the LYNX Blue Line metro, with a new delivery at seemingly every stop. In 4Q’19, Charlotte’s City Council voted to spend $50M for a transportation firm to design a 26-mile Silver Line light-rail connecting the East submarket to Uptown and westward into Gaston County, despite ongoing concerns about how the city will fund the ~$4B project. As competition for tenants increases, landlords have been forced to offer more amenitized space to differentiate their product. Supply growth across the metro is showing no signs of slowing, and though absorption has been healthy investors should remain cautious of the elevated supply pipeline over the next 5 years, especially if economic growth remains sluggish in the next few years. Demand in Midtown and Downtown should stack up favorably as young adults have demonstrated a strong propensity to rent in these submarkets. |Retail sales growth expected to grow above top market average through ’25 driven by resilient labor market|High household income in Central and Southeast submarkets buoy spending power|Above-average working age population growth expectations|Large contraction in overseas visits in ’20 (~50%), uncertain business travel outlook can slow discretionary spending|Below-average occupancy levels signaling weaker retailer health and lower productivity malls|Unfavorable commute times with a poor walk score hampers retail accessibility
7|160|Mall|Chicago|Chicago: The “Capital of the Midwest” exhibits stronger near-term apartment fundamentals than nearby Midwest markets, but Chicago still suffers from concerning long-term demographic and fiscal health trends. Owners are pressured by increasing tax liabilities from reassessed property values as the city / state try to alleviate fiscal woes. Additionally, a November ’20 ballot measure proposes graduated individual income tax rates between 4.95%-7.99%, changing from a current fixed rate of 4.95%. While increasing taxes hurts disposable income and has contributed to some out-migration, the modest silver lining is limited new supply in the market since developers are hesitant of the metro’s higher taxes and rising construction costs. Investors should be aware of the $6B Lincoln Yards master plan, which will phase in ~6k apartment units to the Lincoln Park / Old Town submarket over the intermediate term. In addition to fiscal issues, the metro suffers from millennial out-migration and unattractive employment trends, losing share to markets with higher-paying job opportunities. The wealthy population that resides in the Glencoe / Wilmette submarket, which falls outside of city limits (and thus outside of Chicago’s fiscal issues), pay some of the highest nominal rents across the market. Landlords have been able to consistently push rent in this submarket despite overall metro headwinds.|Affluent, educated northern submarkets buoy spending power|Large, diversified economy - headquarters of 35 Fortune 500 companies|“A-” and better malls (~40% of stock) should prove more resilient in a post-covid retail recovery|Underrepresented in high-growth TAMI industry – lackluster job growth overall|Persistent out-migration of retirees who are more likely to shop in-person vs. utilize ecommerce|Muted retail sales recovery relative to top markets due to high taxes and weak demographics
7|161|Mall|Cincinnati|Cincinnati: Cincinnati’s growth is broadly driven by its exposure to a few large corporate headquarters, including Kroger, Proctor & Gamble, and Macy’s. While large companies have helped propel job growth this last cycle, primarily in the finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE) sectors, a troubled manufacturing industry and lackluster population growth will likely weigh on apartment demand. Proximity to Columbus’ more stable job market hurts Cincinnati’s ability to attract young talent and prevent millennials from migrating. Very affordable single-family housing has also resulted in one of the highest homeownership rates relative to the top markets, which limits an investor’s ability to push apartment rents. One positive for the metro is Proctor and Gamble’s and Kroger’s strong quarterly earnings and forward-guidance in late ‘19, both of whom were facing challenges over the past few years. Despite an encouraging trajectory early in the year for P&G and Kroger, Covid-19 has disrupted future hiring plans for two of Cincinnati’s largest employers. In addition, Macy’s plans to slash ~3,900 corporate and management jobs as part of a restructuring plan will likely further dampen apartment fundamentals. Limited demand tailwinds, affordable homes, underwhelming demographics, and lagging population growth restrict the metro’s long-term NOI growth potential.	|Higher relative discretionary spending stemming from a lower cost of living|A strong Fortune 500 presence in the market drives a stable economy|Mall supply per capita is the lowest among top markets|Low forecasted job growth|Low population density dampens retail sales forecasts in the near-term|Below average occupancy levels signal weak retailer health within the market
7|162|Mall|Cleveland|Cleveland: A lack of young talent and weak job growth point to a continuation of poor apartment fundamentals. Once a manufacturing powerhouse, Cleveland has failed to redefine itself as globalization and technological innovation continue to leave many Rust Belt cities behind. The city suffers from significant out-migration, which is expected to continue over the next 5 years led by a decline in young adults who are relocating for better opportunities. Cleveland’s lone bright spot and best hope for reversing momentum remains in health care. The Case Western Reserve University Medical School and the Cleveland Clinic are large providers of high-paying jobs and economic activity. Investments in the life sciences is underway at the Cleveland Clinic’s research centers that may help generate some growth. However, it remains doubtful that the health care sector’s job growth in isolation will be able to resuscitate the local economy.  The Downtown submarket is demonstrating emerging strength due to a modernization effort by the Downtown Cleveland Alliance to create an innovation district. Despite development initiatives to generate an increasingly vibrant downtown area, Cleveland still struggles to compete with more desirable Midwest markets.	|Economic stability because of exposure to the strong health care sector|Low cost of living boosts disposable income|Affluent pockets in Medina and Geauga buoy spending power|The Downtown submarket averages lower quality assets compared to other submarkets (e.g., Ave. at Tower City Center)|Weak economic growth expected to negatively impact retail sales growth |Population outflow is expected to continue
7|168|Mall|Denver|Denver: Denver continues to attract jobs from a diverse set of employment bases. YoY TAMI job growth  has been trending at an average of ~4% each month since the beginning of ’19. TAMI growth is supported by the in-migration of several startups and small tech firms, along with tech giants such as Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, and Apple. High-quality job opportunities, coupled with Denver’s desirable quality of life and access to nature, have attracted many young residents, making “The Mile-High City” a hot spot for millennial migration. Millennial demand has skyrocketed in trendy neighborhoods such as the LoHi / Highlands neighborhood in the Golden / Wheatridge submarket, and the RiNo Arts District in the Northeast submarket. Demand in the Downtown submarket is bolstered by the walkable, urban environment. Continued interest from affluent, highly-compensated millennials in these submarkets should allow for strong rent growth potential. The market’s low initial investment yields are offset by solid long-term growth, driving above-average risk-adjusted returns.|Above-average sales / SF driven by income growth and affluent population|Economy is driven by diverse sectors, with heavy influence from high paying TAMI and FIRE jobs, which should increase spending power|The market has some destination properties with high TAP scores; notably Cherry Creek Mall and Park Meadows|Health of local retailers questionable in fallout of pandemic induced recession; low quality malls will have issues recovering |Demographic mix may lead to relatively high adoption of ecommerce|Cost of living has increased and reduced discretionary spending across the market
7|169|Mall|Detroit|Detroit: Optimism in the “Motor City” is fading as employment figures weaken and investment in the market is failing to provide substantial and sustainable improvement. Economic growth is expected to lag the rest of the Midwest through the intermediate term, even with substantial investments from billionaire Dan Gilbert and national automotive companies. The metro is hindered by continued dependence on stagnating industries and fails to make a meaningful economic shift toward higher-growth industries. TAMI jobs have seen consistent net outflow for years, and overall employment growth in Detroit ranks among the lowest across top markets (~35% of the population lives below the poverty line). The lack of well-paying jobs hampers in-migration as new graduates and millennials choose more desirable markets that offer better compensation to start their careers. Tepid demand from minimal population and job growth mixed with low supply barriers provide a weak intermediate-term outlook for the apartment sector. Additionally, rising construction costs are leading developers to rethink their plans or ditch them all together as rents cannot keep up with increasing development costs. This is exemplified in projects like the East Jefferson Meijer, originally planned as a 213-unit mixed-use apartment / small-format grocer development that was abandoned in favor of a larger-format grocery store and parking lot. While the market has improved substantially since its bankruptcy in ‘13, the outlook still looks bleak.|Automakers’ investment in electric vehicle production will likely be accompanied with higher-paying jobs|Low cost-of-living relative to most top markets|Stronger spending power PSF in the Northwest suburbs, specifically near the Somerset Collection and Briarwood malls|Below-average demographic and employment growth that will weigh on projected retail sales growth|Severely over-retailed market; the metro has the highest mall supply per capita relative to the top markets|Low quality / struggling malls will likely have a less attractive redevelopment play due to minimal supply barriers
7|171|Mall|Fairfield County|Fairfield County: Statewide fiscal concerns and tepid job growth continue to suppress apartment fundamentals in Fairfield County. Outsized municipal debt and unfunded liabilities have forced higher tax rates, a major determinant for several corporate HQ departures over the past few years (e.g., GE to Boston, Starwood to Miami). Fairfield County has not been able to attract any large relocations to backfill those gaps left behind. Meanwhile, the metro continues to face the headwinds of a shift from active to passive investment management, though FIRE employment improved in '18 after 22 consecutive months of YoY job declines. The market serves as a suburban living alternative to Manhattan which attracts more families looking to live in homes than rent apartments. Millennial population growth continues to decelerate as more prefer to live closer to Manhattan-based jobs.  While limited new construction will support apartment rent growth, unfavorable demographics and fiscal health issues should handcuff long-term NOI growth.|Abundance of high earning residents|Infill market; high number of superzips per mall|Spillover demand from NYC|SALT tax reform reduces disposable income for high earners|SoNo Collection adding a block of supply in 2H‘19|State’s fiscal concern causing employer departures
7|172|Mall|Fort Lauderdale|Fort Lauderdale: Moderate job and population growth paired with middle-of-the-pack supply growth create a mixed outlook for Fort Lauderdale apartments. While tourism has historically been the primary economic growth driver, Fort Lauderdale’s economy is diversifying with a promising life sciences sector and steady job growth in the FIRE and professional / business services industries. The Fort Lauderdale, Plantation, and Miramar / Pembroke Pines submarkets have seen the most supply as developers seek opportunity north of Miami. Las Olas Boulevard in the Fort Lauderdale submarket has attracted significant development due to its walkable lifestyle and downtown feel. Las Olas Walk, a mixed-use development, will add ~1,200 luxury rental units to the submarket by late '20. For favorable demographics and a limited supply pipeline, investors should look to the Davie submarket, which boasts the wealthiest and most educated residents in the metro.  While Fort Lauderdale’s coastal location and steady job growth support a healthy rent profile, the market’s outlook is moderated by condo oversupply in the near term and a lack of meaningful supply barriers over the long term. |Desirable location promotes tourism|Increased regional mobility to help drive retail demand|Lower cost of living increases disposable income	|Hurricane risks increase cap-ex burden|Competes with Miami's famous shopping scene and top malls|Tourism to remain muted due to Covid-19 pandemic
7|177|Mall|Houston|Houston: After being impacted heavily by the energy bust in ’15, Houston’s economy is still recovering. A silver lining of the energy recession is a slightly more diversified economy; the health care sector has seen growth, exemplified by Texas Medical Center becoming the world’s largest medical complex. Petrochemical manufacturing and other downstream energy activities have also experienced outsized growth. Although Houston has diversified its economy in recent years, the 1Q’20 collapse in oil prices and Covid-19 pandemic have presented additional challenges for the market. A large amount of supply was delivered directly into the energy recession and is still being absorbed by the market, as evidenced by below-average occupancy rates. Now, given the current uncertain economic environment, the already-present vacancy rate troubles will likely be prolonged. The current supply pipeline, while not massive, is large enough to continue to put downward pressure on intermediate-term M-RevPAF growth. A lack of zoning laws and a sprawling metroplex provide little regulatory or physical barriers to entry, suppressing long-term growth. Investors should look west towards the Montrose / River Oaks and Museum submarkets where there are higher incomes, more expensive housing, and elevated rents, but in aggregate expect below-average long-term returns, as higher going in yields are offset by lackluster long-term NOI growth potential.|Younger demographic and robust population growth outlook|No state income tax and low cost of living|Job growth forecast outpaces the top market average|Below average occupancy levels indicate weaker retailer mixes|Household incomes tilt to the lower end, spending power is limited|Minimal supply barriers and below-average mall supply per capita, making it a prime candidate for new competition
7|178|Mall|Indianapolis|Indianapolis: The capital of the “Hoosier State” has little to offer apartment investors in terms of long-term rent growth, as structural headwinds stemming from poor demographics and minimal supply constraints create a challenging environment. The job growth occurring is largely seen in the warehouse and manufacturing sectors which, combined with an outflow of high-paying TAMI jobs, limits income growth potential. While a quicker Covid-19 recovery is expected in Indianapolis over the next few years, the market should revert to below-average long-term growth relative to other top markets. Rent growth is constrained by affordable homeownership options available throughout the metro, and despite low regulatory and physical barriers, supply growth screens below average. Most of the development occurring in the metro can be found in the Downtown and Southwest submarkets. Meanwhile, the surrounding suburban submarkets exhibit the highest median incomes in the metro and have had more success in attracting investors (e.g., Spruce Capital, who purchased a ~1k unit suburban portfolio in early ’20). Though strong intermediate-term growth and high going-in yields screen attractive on the surface, affordable home prices allow renters to quickly transition into homeowners, hurting long-term rent growth potential.|Below-average cost of living boosts disposable income for residents|More affluent demographics in the Fishers / Noblesville submarket lead to higher TAP scores|A low unemployment rate will support economic recovery|Below-average retail sales growth projections as a result of population out-migration|Outflow of jobs in high paying sectors (i.e., TAMI) limits spending power|Below-average occupancy levels signal weaker retailer profiles
7|179|Mall|Jacksonville|Jacksonville: While healthy population and job growth bode well for apartment demand in Jacksonville, supply growth concerns weigh heavily on long-term rent growth potential. The Southside submarket is seeing the bulk of oncoming supply as it has both cheap land for development and is home to a younger and more educated population. The Arlington and Downtown submarkets are also seeing significant supply growth, particularly as the city and developers try to revitalize downtown to attract and retain more residents.  Notable developments include the District, a $600M mixed-use development on the Southbank that will add ~1k residential units, a hotel, and a marina to the metro. Near the Southbank, San Marco is seeing substantial development with ~800 units to be added by '21. Investors should look to the Beaches submarket, which benefits from the market’s highest rents and limited supply along the coast. Strong population and employment growth will help Jacksonville weather the upcoming recession reasonably well, leading to above-average near-term M-RevPAF growth; however, the lack of any meaningful barriers to supply outside of the coast restrains long-term rent growth potential.   |Overall population growth is expected to support retail sales through ‘25|Corporate in-migration and smaller leisure concentration will likely assist employment growth through ‘25|Mall supply per capita is significantly below that of comparable Florida markets|Anemic sales productivity potential as household income distribution tilts towards lower earners|Poor quality malls throughout the market will hamper retail outlook given changes in mall landscape|Weak population density aids retail stress, evidenced by JCPenney Regency Square Mall closure in ‘20
7|180|Mall|Kansas City|Kansas City: A shallower trough in Covid-induced job losses versus most markets and solid expected intermediate growth are bright spots for Kansas City, but the metro’s longer-term return prospects continue to be hampered by structural headwinds. While the market’s supply pipeline remains below-average, new units will likely struggle to be absorbed in the face of subpar income and population growth. Employers such as the USDA and CarMax have chosen to establish new operations within the market, attracted by low costs of living and doing business. Existing companies such as Cerner, Garmin, and Burns McDonnel have all announced that they are expanding their footprint in the metro with plans to add over 18k combined jobs in the next few years (~3% expansion of the existing non-farm workforce). While hiring by these companies and efforts to improve local transportation infrastructure may help the metro recover from the Covid-19 fallout more quickly over the intermediate term, the metro’s continued inability to draw high-paying employers results in unfavorable long-term growth, driving below-average risk-adjusted returns.|High amounts of REIT ownership in existing malls; more power to attract quality tenants|Existing demographics have higher propensity to shop in-person|Below average mall supply per capita favors existing operators ability to push rents|Below average sales PSF|Credit quality of tenants in existing malls sub-par and reflected in below average occupancy levels |Renovation in Country Club Plaza may increase cap-ex requirements for other malls as competition intensifies
7|182|Mall|Las Vegas|Las Vegas: Above-average job growth has bolstered Las Vegas apartment fundamentals in recent years, but this trend has dramatically reversed with Covid-19’s outsized hit on the hospitality and leisure industries. The market now faces all-time high levels of unemployment, among the worst of the top markets. The economy’s heavy reliance on the tourism and hospitality industries has proven to be an extreme risk, and its health will greatly depend on the future progression of the virus and the availability of a vaccine. Though jobs are expected to return in the future, and the Allegiant Stadium completion is expected to create ~1.2k new jobs, apartment demand will continue to face long-term fundamental headwinds created by a cheap single-family market that incentivizes homeownership and lower-paying job growth. As residents continue to migrate from California, many immediately look at investing in a home as housing prices are very affordable relative to the high-cost, West Coast markets. A strong focus on single family development has kept apartment supply in check, a positive for owners, but very low going-in yields combined with an uncertain path of recovery over the long-term limit investors’ return potential.|Intermediate-term population growth is among the highest of the top markets due to the low-cost nature of the market|As the gaming capital of the U.S., tourism should resume and boost retail sales once mass immunity is achieved|A strong luxury retailer presence aids sales productivity on “The Strip”|The economy’s reliance on the gaming / hospitality sectors has proven to be a great risk|LT business travel expected to fall 5-10%, hindering sales as convention patrons spend 20% more than leisure visitors|Job growth in low-paying sectors has put a limiting factor on intermediate-term income growth
7|185|Mall|Long Island|Long Island: After underwhelming job growth through much of the recent upcycle, Long Island’s local economy was one of the worst performers among the top  markets following the onset of the recession. The health care and education sectors, which have historically been a bright spot for job growth, experienced net declines throughout 1H’20, though the metro’s large government sector (~15% of jobs) held up relatively well. Long Island’s apartment demand generally benefits from New York City spillover, but this effect may be limited in the near term as the city grapples with economic fallout from the pandemic. It remains to be seen if tech growth in NYC will continue at its recent pace given the city’s fiscal issues and the acceleration in working from home, but already-announced expansions in ’19 (e.g., Google, Facebook, and Amazon) will provide incremental apartment demand. However, this will largely be confined to NYC’s urban core and Long Island submarkets in close proximity to Manhattan (i.e., Hempstead). Nearly 30% of Long Island’s population is between the ages of 45-64, among the highest across the top markets. As such, the region will likely never be a top destination for apartment investors due to its older, homeowning demographic, but a light supply pipeline should mitigate the job loss impact on rent growth to an extent.|“A-” and better malls (~68% of stock) should prove more resilient in a post-covid retail recovery|Favorable demographics; affluent, dense population and high spending power PSF|Western  submarkets (e.g., Hempstead, Huntington / Babylon) hold higher TAP scores due to NYC proximity|Elevated mall supply per capita leaves a concerning outlook for lower rated malls as retail headwinds continue|Weak local economy; limited income growth and poor employment growth|Urban draw has limited population growth
7|186|Mall|Los Angeles|Los Angeles: The LA apartment market is comprised of many cities across a vast geographic area and contains some of the highest barrier-to-entry submarkets in the nation (e.g., Santa Monica, Malibu Hills). Demand for housing in LA continues to exceed available supply, putting pressure on renters in a high-barrier, landlord-favored market. In 2H’19, AB 1482 was enacted by Governor Newsom implementing statewide rent control for renewal offers on apartments older than 15 years. The law will be in effect from January ’20 until January ‘30. Additionally, Prop 21, a measure to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, will appear on the November ’20 ballot (a similar ballot measure failed in ’18), reigniting concern amongst landlords that local governments may be able to enact more restrictive forms of rent control. Prospective investors should look west of the I-405 freeway, known as the Westside, for the strongest long-term rent growth potential as these highly desirable and supply-constrained submarkets are supported by healthy demographics and solid high-paying job growth. Los Angeles is one of the most highly regulated markets in the U.S., as geographical barriers, NIMBYism, and elevated construction costs keep supply in check. Tight supply dynamics and robust demand will continue to contribute to strong long-term NOI growth for the market.|Highly dense population |Pockets of wealth in Beverly Hills, Culver City and Santa Monica|Home to high-productivity malls (e.g., Century City and The Grove)|High cost of living and taxes drag on discretionary income|Highly competitive market could lead to high cap-ex burden|Recent minimum wage hike to $15 / hr in 3Q'20 may reduce profitability 
7|187|Mall|Louisville|Louisville: With a regional focus and high employment concentration in manufacturing and other traditionally low-growth industries, Louisville’s economic prospects remain muted as compared with its Midwest peers. Some job growth has occurred in the metro, but mainly in the low-wage manufacturing and wholesale sectors; employment growth in the higher-paying TAMI and FIRE industries has been virtually nonexistent. A lack of demand stemming from minimal job growth is exacerbated by the metro’s relatively less desirable lifestyle, evident by minimal millennial population inflow. Demand headwinds and lack of  supply barriers limit a landlord’s ability to push rent. Additionally, the market’s low cost of living  drives homeownership relative to other metros, further hindering long-term rent growth.

7|188|Mall|Memphis|Memphis: The Memphis economy continues to miss out on the wave of growth in the technology and professional services industries that has propelled other southern metros. Concentrated in the trade and manufacturing sectors, Memphis’s undiversified and stagnant economy establishes a low ceiling on rent growth as high-paying jobs are few and far between. One of the few strengths of the markets lies in its low cash flow volatility, bolstered in part by a handful of Fortune 500 HQs. As the economy continues to find its footing amidst an on-going recession, Memphis’s low tech exposure contributes to a near-term M-RevPAF growth prospect that is expected to slightly outperform our top market average. TAMI and FIRE employment bases in Memphis are small and growing at a meager pace. Demographics in the ‘Home of Blues’ also bode poorly, as population growth significantly lags that of other southern metros and low-to-middle income households comprise a larger share of the market than the national average. Poor market fundamentals and struggling demographics, compounded by an active supply pipeline, present headwinds that render Memphis’ return profile among the least attractive in the country.|Large corporations add stability to market (e.g. FedEx, AutoZone, etc.)|No state income taxes (salaries and wages) leaves room for more disposable income|Low cost of living relative to nearby markets|High retail inventory per capita|Average tenant sales remain extremely low relative to top markets|Lack of population and income growth limit potential
7|189|Mall|Miami|Miami: Miami’s business-friendly environment and cultural amenities support healthy demographics and long-term apartment fundamentals. Since '13, Miami has seen domestic out-migration, largely to other Florida metros, as some residents are priced out of the growing city; however, international immigrants and high-earners seeking low taxes have driven steady per-capita income growth (average income of a person moving to Miami has exceeded those leaving). Miami’s low-tax environment has also attracted a growing tech / finance presence and solid job growth in the metro. Elevated supply, largely in the Downtown, Opa-Locka, and Miami Beach submarkets, remains a concern but is outweighed by strong demand growth, resulting in a healthy near-term M-RevPAF growth forecast. In the Downtown submarket, the trendy Wynwood and the Design District neighborhoods are seeing notable supply in response to their popularity with millennials, while Little Haiti has been pegged as the next neighborhood to gentrify. Investors should also take note of Miami Worldcenter, a mixed-use project that will add ~1.9k new apartment units to the Downtown submarket by '21. Brickell remains a favorite submarket for its central location and strong demographics while Coral Gables stands out for its minimal supply pipeline. As a desirable metro with favorable demographics, Miami’s long-term rent growth potential for apartments is among the best of our top markets. 	|Globally known shopping destination, a viable long-term demand profile |No personal income tax increases disposable income |Income growth bests all other Florida metros|Growing inventory of desirable lifestyle malls, including planned American Dream Miami which plans to open in ’25|Losing residents to lower-cost Florida metros|Tourism industry suffering from Covid-19 pandemic and likely to remain muted in ’21
7|191|Mall|Minneapolis|Minneapolis: Despite a number of large, stable employers, a full construction pipeline is weighing on Minneapolis’ intermediate rent growth outlook. Long-term advantages for the market include an outsized presence of S&P 500 companies and an educated labor force from nearby universities. However, local health care employment growth decelerated meaningfully throughout ’19 and bears watching moving forward. Local housing policy changes are further complicating the picture for apartment investors; Minneapolis’ “2040 Comprehensive Plan” upzones the majority of the city and effectively decreases supply barriers for much of the market. Furthermore, inclusionary zoning efforts are currently underway, intending to mandate that a portion of newly developed units be set aside as affordable housing. Currently, an interim plan is in place with the intention of more robust legislation being enacted. Elevated new supply and tepid employment growth over the coming years result in below-average market rent growth and weak long-term growth estimates.|Robust TAMI and FIRE growth in recent years; typically accompanied with higher-paying jobs|Stronger demographics relative to Midwest peers; significantly higher median household income and population growth|Affluent population supported by proximity of large universities and outsized presence of 18 Fortune 500 HQ’s|Mall of America, largest shopping and entertainment complex in the U.S., dominates the regional mall landscape|Significantly below-average TAP score in the metro, largely impacted by low population density|Large and growing ecommerce presence impacts local retailers; 6 mall properties have at least 1 vacant anchor
7|192|Mall|Nashville|Nashville: Nashville’s educated workforce, relative affordability, and significant population growth have attracted large companies to the metro. Alliance Bernstein is relocating its global headquarters, which will bring ~1,050 jobs to Nashville, and Amazon plans to bring another ~5,000 jobs to its new downtown operations hub, both of whom began hiring in '19 and will continue to hire through '24. The meaningful job growth over the past couple years has been a positive tailwind for apartment fundamentals. As rents climbed over the past several years during this local economic boom, regulators have altered zoning laws that allow for more developments in the urban core, leading to increased supply. The meaningful new supply is driving below-average M-RevPAF growth expectations despite significant in-migration and job growth. Nashville also benefits from a leading health care industry; 17 publicly traded health care companies are headquartered in the city, which supports high-paying jobs and economic stability. One caution facing apartment demand is the high homeownership rate outside of the Downtown and Airport submarkets.  While a healthy supply pipeline and high homeownership rate pose some threats to apartment fundamentals, the stable health care industry and significant population growth provides investors with solid long-term growth potential.|High local spending power per square foot boosted by a low cost of living|Millennials attracted for work and vacation; vibrant local entertainment scene|Continued investment in existing high-quality malls such as The Mall at Green Hills; ~$200M in renovations |Large millennial demographic may decrease propensity to shop in-person|Increasing vacancy among existing stock decreases attractiveness for tenants; Rivergate occupancy down ~10% since ‘17|The impact of the pandemic will drive tourism visits down in the near term
7|195|Mall|New York|New York: As the epicenter of the U.S. pandemic, New York faced steep job losses and deteriorating apartment fundamentals in the first half of ‘20. Finance remains the backbone of New York’s economy, and though not immune from layoffs, fared better than most industries in 1H’20. Growing tech interest in the city of late is a bright spot for apartment demand, with Facebook, Google, and Amazon all announcing large-scale expansions in ’19 (>20k jobs collectively). However, it remains to be seen if tech companies will modify pre-COVID plans following the acceleration in working from home. NYC would be a relative loser to lower-cost metros in a world where remote working becomes widely adopted. New York’s budget deficits worsened following the pandemic, and now require an estimated  ~600 bps increase to the median renter’s tax burden to cover the shortfall, which could accelerate recent outmigration. Asking rents fell precipitously in 1H’20 (~-10% YoY) and leasing activity was accompanied by a notable rise in concessions (~50% of new leases included concessions as of June ‘20). Just as investors began to wrap their heads around the expansive rent control laws passed in June ’19 by the state, transaction markets froze in 2Q’20 due to uncertainty surrounding asset prices, which have likely fallen double-digits.. A favorable supply outlook remains a silver lining for NYC, but apartment investors face significant headwinds in the coming years and a less-favorable long-term outlook in a post-COVID world. |High incomes and population density support retail demand|“A-” and better malls (90% of inventory) should prove more resilient in post-Covid retail recovery|Highest TAP scores (99+) found in Manhattan – outer boroughs score above top market average|Street retail competes for mall tenants and spending dollars|Foot traffic reliant on tourism industry which may take time recover to pre-pandemic levels|Poor fiscal health may raise tax bills
7|196|Mall|Norfolk / Hampton Roads|Norfolk/Hampton Roads: The Norfolk / Hampton Roads market has experienced instability in recent years as the region’s reliance upon shipbuilding and government sector employment has taken a sizeable hit due to fiscal budget volatility and waning demand for shipbuilding. It is still unclear whether trade conflict with China will escalate and adversely affect market fundamentals. Steady growth in professional and business services has helped offset declines in government employment. Norfolk has the unique benefit of being a military town, as many military service members provide a foundation for the renter population. Local politicians have noted the need for increased retention of young adults to boost the regional economy and have spearheaded several initiatives to increase its cultural appeal. The efforts haven’t resulted in any major relocations, but the development of Ferguson’s new 8-story corporate HQ in Newport News, which was heavily subsidized by the city, provides anecdotal evidence that the government is ready and willing to sponsor local businesses. Retention of young adults will be critical to both the Norfolk / Hampton Roads economy as well as for renter demand. |Seasonal tourism benefits coastal markets|Affordable cost of living|Moderate income growth projections|Inability to attract large corporate relocations|Limited number of superzips to support spending|Weak market demographics, few high-paying jobs
7|197|Mall|New Jersey (Northern)|New Jersey (Northern): Outsized job losses and subpar population growth pressure apartment fundamentals in Northern New Jersey. The metro serves as a cheaper alternative to Manhattan, especially in the urban Hudson County, but spillover demand from NYC has yet to translate into strong M-RevPAF growth. Several submarkets, including Hoboken and Jersey City, may begin to benefit from proximity to high-paying job growth across the river in Hudson Yards. The rise in work from home may accelerate this phenomenon, but it remains to be seen whether renters would rather flee NYC’s urban core for the cheaper NJ region, or instead opt to leave the NY-NJ area altogether given New Jersey’s dire fiscal health profile (~700bp tax increase required to cover the state’s unfunded liabilities). Future job forecasts remain underwhelming, but M-RevPAF growth should prove less sensitive to the economy in the near term. The expiration of the “Grow NJ” tax incentive program in ’19 dealt another blow to the region as the state has yet to find a replacement despite its moderate success in attracting relocations to the northern part of the state. Without tax incentives, Northern New Jersey will likely continue to shed jobs to more affordable metros, as companies are enticed by lower costs of business and faster-growing labor pools. Rent growth has lagged the top markets following elevated deliveries in ’17 and ’18, but the current supply pipeline should allow fundamentals to play catch-up in the intermediate term, resulting in a modest return profile.|Affluent residents with high spending power PSF|Above average occupancy levels, indicating a healthier retailer mix|High quality malls (A- or better) represents ~86% of stock which should prove resilient in a post-Covid retail recovery|American Dream mall added ~1.3M SF of retail inventory in 3Q’19  – full effects of new supply delayed by pandemic|Subpar intermediate economic growth and population growth coming out of the pandemic|Bergen County law forbids retail sales on Sundays
7|198|Mall|Oakland-East Bay|Oakland-East Bay: While the East Bay has often been overlooked by institutional capital in past cycles, exceptionally low cap rates and softening fundamentals in neighboring Bay Area markets could shift additional interest to the relatively higher going-in yields in Oakland. Though still in the early innings, if the current work from home trend continues to accelerate, Oakland could be a relative winner as renters seek cheaper alternatives to San Francisco and Silicon Valley. Near-term growth forecasts reflect slightly stronger performance relative to its Bay Area peers as a result of these developing trends. Employer interest in Oakland has grown in recent years with multiple companies (e.g., Facebook and Microsoft) expressing interest in the area, a trend that should contribute to healthy population growth. In late ’19,  Facebook announced plans to increase their footprint in the market to upwards of ~1.3M SF of office space, which appears to be moving forward as planned. Increasingly strict California regulations and NIMBYism throughout the market keep the development pipeline lower than average. The Downtown submarket, however, should continue to see elevated deliveries in the near and intermediate term as a result of its proximity to public transit and its walkability, making it an appealing location for young renters and employees commuting into San Francisco. Though going-in yields remain low, healthy intermediate- and long-term NOI growth contribute to returns that rank among the top of the pack.  |High TAP Scores as a result of strong demographics |Favorable supply per capita relative to top market average|Wealthy, affluent residents drive fundamentals|Strict lockdown policies in the Bay Area may have an outsized impact on in line tenants |Above-average vacancies persist in the market - weighs on landlords ability to push rents |Strong competition from retail destinations in San Francisco
7|201|Mall|Orange County|Orange County: Healthy income growth and limited development have been the key drivers of Orange County’s improving apartment fundamentals in recent years. Job growth in Orange County has been mediocre of late, but the region enjoys a diversified workforce led by notable companies like Walt Disney, Boeing, and The Irvine Company. Because of the market’s housing costs, which are amongst the highest in the nation, residents are often forced to rent, creating a tailwind for apartment demand. California recently enacted a series of bills intended to address the state’s affordability issues, which may make it incrementally easier to develop apartments; however, multifamily permitting activity growth has consistently slowed over the last 3 years. In 2H’19, AB 1482 was enacted by Governor Newsom implementing statewide rent control for renewal offers on apartments that are older than 15 years. The law will be in effect beginning in January ’20 until January ‘30. Additionally, Prop 21, a measure to amend the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, will appear on the November ’20 ballot (a similar ballot measure failed in ’18), reigniting fear amongst landlords that local governments may be able to enact more restrictive forms of rent control. Investors should also be cognizant of The Irvine Company, which controls much of the region’s inventory and often influences market rents.|Home to high productivity malls (e.g., Fashion Island, South Coast Plaza)|Highly dense and wealthy local population|Historically healthy levels of spending power per square foot of retail space|Below-average job growth forecasts  |Increased risk of out-migration resulting in weak population growth estimates|High cost of living and taxes drags on discretionary income
7|202|Mall|Orlando|Orlando: Orlando is the most visited destination in the country with >70M annual visitors. With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, international travel has halted, damaging Orlando’s tourism-based economy and driving the unemployment rate to be among the worst of top markets in the early innings of the downturn. In recent years, Florida's business-friendly environment and the growth of the University of Central Florida have brought higher-wage jobs, such as professional services and health care, to the market, providing some insulation from Covid-19 fallout. Supply growth in Orlando is among the highest of top markets with the Southwest, South Central, and Maitland / Winter Park submarkets seeing the brunt of oncoming supply. Notable developments include downtown’s Creative Village, where UCF and Valencia’s shared campus opened in the summer of '19, bringing >7k students to downtown with long-term plans for ~15k students and >1.5k apartment units in the development. Despite supply growth concerns, investors should look to Maitland / Winter Park and South Central, particularly Thornton Park, for some of the market’s highest rents. Ultimately, investors should expect challenged near-term fundamentals as Orlando faces a tough recovery and struggles to absorb an elevated supply pipeline. In the long term, exceptional job and population growth create a healthy outlook for Orlando’s rent growth potential, though cap rates have compressed meaningfully in the market pre-Covid-19, tempering long-term return potential. |Status as the most visited city in the U.S. and an international travel destination to benefit metro in long-term|The metro boasts a younger and wealthier population than the Florida average|MCO, the nation’s 3rd largest airport, to benefit from a $4.3B expansion with a new terminal opening in ’22|Tourism to remain muted throughout the Covid-19 pandemic|Occupancy suffers from 2 Macy’s, 4 Sears, and 4 JCPenney closures since '17|Income growth well below top market average
7|203|Mall|Palm Beach|Palm Beach: With population growth forecasts that best its South Florida peers and many top markets, Palm Beach is gradually evolving from a sleepy retirement town to an up-and-coming metro. Attracted to the market’s amenities, affordability, and low taxes, financial and business services companies have relocated to the metro while the hospitality and health care industries have also seen consistent growth. Virgin Trains USA now connects Palm Beach to Miami and will connect Palm Beach to Orlando in coming years. Supply growth, centered in the West Palm Beach, Lake Worth, and Boca Raton submarkets remains elevated, but has moderated after a spike in ‘17. Investors should look to the Boca Raton East submarket, which stands out for having the most educated population and the highest rents in the metro. Strong growth forecasts and a desirable lifestyle bode well for Palm Beach, ranking it above most top markets in terms of long-term rent growth potential and near-term M-RevPAF growth expectations. 	|Population growth bests of all South Florida and most top markets|No state income tax|Large concentration of wealthy retirees|Must compete with broader South Florida economy and famous Miami shopping scene|Income growth among the lowest of top markets|Tourism to struggle throughout the Covid-19 pandemic 
7|204|Mall|Philadelphia|Philadelphia: Philadelphia’s affordability versus other major East Coast markets (e.g., New York, D.C.) is a draw for some renters, but underwhelming job growth expectations sets the stage for below-average apartment fundamentals. The region’s large education and health care presence (e.g., University of Pennsylvania, Jefferson Healthcare system) provides stable employment, and a rapidly-growing life sciences industry has been a bright spot in Philly’s otherwise tepid economy, attracting strong venture capital inflows to the city (~$2.5B in ’19). The influx of tech funding paired with an abundance of local research facilities is expected to drive above-average income growth. The city’s punitive tax structure and unfriendly business environment largely limits major corporate relocations to the metro, and most cities that do set up shop choose to do so in the suburbs where taxes are less onerous. As such, there is a disconnect between where typical apartment renters live (CBD) and where the job growth is concentrated (suburbs). Investments in the city center and a drastically reduced crime rate have improved the city’s ability in retaining young talent (25-34 age cohort population growth has outpaced the overall average), but total population trends still prove worrisome. Philly’s capital flows are better than the city’s historic record, driven by smaller investors expanding outside of the surrounding metros in search of higher going-in yields.|Strong TAP Scores in Cherry Hill, Lower Merion submarkets|Above-average median household income supports discretionary spending|Dense population drives high foot traffic downtown and in nearby submarkets|Below-average retail sales growth projections demonstrates risk of alternative land use|Only 39% of mall stock is ‘A-’ quality or better; outsized risk of obsolescence and / or higher cap-ex requirements|Low population density in suburbs leads to low foot traffic, especially in Exton and Gloucester County submarkets
7|205|Mall|Phoenix|Phoenix: Phoenix apartment fundamentals are bolstered by top-ranked job and population growth expectations. As a low-cost alternative to major California markets, Phoenix continues to draw residents from its neighbors to the west. Infosys, an IT services company, will move into the newly-delivered Novus Innovation Corridor in the North Tempe submarket once offices are able to reopen and intend to bring ~1k jobs to Phoenix by ’23. As additional companies are attracted to Tempe, apartment demand in the North and South Tempe submarkets should increase due to the walkable, urban amenities, and access to various transit alternatives. The Roosevelt Row (RoRo) neighborhood in the Downtown submarket is an up-and-coming neighborhood that is growing in popularity. Demand in Phoenix is expected to continue outpacing the high levels of supply for now, leading to relatively high levels of near-term M-RevPAF growth. Over longer periods of time, supply will likely catch up with demand, resulting in average long-term growth prospects. |Low-cost alternative to West Coast markets; should continue to benefit from urban flight trends|Top-ranked retail sales growth expectations are aided by the positive outlook for intermediate-term population growth|Phoenix is growing as an emerging tech market, improving the quality of job growth|The market is dominated by Scottsdale Fashion Square and Scottsdale Quarter|Prop 208 passed in Nov. ’20 which will increase income taxes to 8% for Phoenix’s top earners|Below-average median HHI; wealth concentrated very few submarkets (i.e., North Scottsdale, Chandler / Gilbert)
7|206|Mall|Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh: Investors should exhibit cautious optimism when considering the “Steel City’s” apartment sector. While the Pittsburgh economy lags nearby East Coast metros due to its dependence on low-growth industries, a strong university system supports the nascent tech industry that is slowly gaining traction in the metro. Though employers like Apple, Facebook, and Google recruit from these universities that specialize in artificial intelligence, life sciences, and robotics projects, overall employment growth in other sectors remains poor and Pittsburgh’s tech scene is still growing off a low base. Much of the development and transactions in the apartment sector occur in the CBD and Oakland / East End submarkets. Here, investors find the highest rent growth potential while still yielding attractive going-in cap rates. These submarkets are changing from aging industrial buildings to new office and apartment developments. The $273M “3 Crossings” master plan is set to build 2 apartment buildings with ~300 units by ‘21, among other developments. Despite these emerging positive trends, caution should be exhibited as the metro battles high millennial out-migration rates as graduates from the metro’s elite university systems look toward more desirable markets for employment. Additionally, rent growth is limited by the metro’s lack of supply constraints and inexpensive home prices, which drive high homeownership rates. Pittsburgh displays one of the highest economic cap rates in the nation, but worrying long-term growth prospects deserve a watchful eye.|Affordable cost of living increases disposable income|Pockets of affluence in Cranberry Township submarket buoying market spending power|Pittsburgh’s emerging life science market is improving the quality of job growth|Only 18% of Mall stock is ‘A-’ quality or better; outsized obsolescence risk |High retail supply per capita prevents strong rent growth|High unemployment rate weighs on consumer balance sheets
7|207|Mall|Portland|Portland: Portland’s apartment fundamentals are driven by solid job and population growth among young adults looking for relative affordability and a high quality of life. The significant in-migration has resulted in robust rent growth over the last few years; however, developers have quickly caught on. Completions in ’19 reached an all-time high and while fewer new starts are now expected because of Covid-19, projects still in the pipeline will likely outpace demand in the coming years. Portland’s decision to enact statewide rent control has garnered national attention, and while the long-term impact of the new law remains unknown, it is expected to have a minimal effect on short-term apartment fundamentals since the 7+% inflation rent cap is far above rent growth projections. The concern lies within whether it will lead to tighter limits down the road that would negatively impact investors' ability to increase rents, hurting overall returns. A recently-passed measure that requires cities with >25,000 people to allow duplexes, triplexes, and quadplexes in areas zoned for single-family suggest already-low barriers to supply will ease further.	|No sales tax drives retail demand from Portland residents and those living on the near-by Washington-state lines|One of the least over-retailed markets on a supply per capita basis relative to the top markets|Favorable demographics and steady job growth underpin the strong retail sales growth|Increasing housing costs and property taxes reduces disposable income|The large and growing millennial presence accelerated ecommerce penetration in the metro|The East submarket, which has the lowest TAP score, will likely underperform the rest of the market
7|209|Mall|Raleigh-Durham|Raleigh-Durham: Raleigh’s demographic profile has improved meaningfully after benefiting from exceptional employment growth over the last cycle and experiencing an influx of younger age cohorts. The recent demographic trends are expected to continue with near-term employment growth forecasted to be amongst the strongest of our top markets. Proximity to top universities, affordable living costs, and desirable submarkets are some of the key factors behind Raleigh’s strong population growth and domestic in-migration trends. As a result of strengthening demographics, M-RevPAF growth forecasts are expected to outperform most of our top markets. Raleigh’s booming apartment demand, however, has not been overlooked by local developers, and with low barriers to development, supply growth should continue to restrain rent growth over the next few years. One notable project contributing to the elevated supply pipeline in ’20 and ’21 includes Midtown Exchange, a $1B mixed-use project that will include ~1,300 new apartment units. Strong long-term growth forecasts offset low going-in yields following cap rate compression in recent years, resulting in solid return expectations. |Favorable shift in demographics over the next several years through in-migration and millennial population growth|Above-average household income in key retail submarkets Cary and Northwest Raleigh aided by office job outperformance|Retail sales growth expected to accelerate and outpace national average by ~2x in ‘21|Low sales productivity for most malls in the market; The Streets at Southpoint is the exception|Weak population density outside of Central Raleigh|Current occupancy levels below the market average, signaling a weaker retailer mix.
7|210|Mall|Richmond|Richmond: A relatively affordable lifestyle and decent Fortune 500 presence drive apartment demand in Richmond, including headquarters for notable companies such as Altria and Carmax. The local economy relies heavily on business services and government jobs. Despite the region’s favorable cost of business, job growth has lagged behind the top market average consistently since mid-’16 (though the trend  somewhat reversed in 1H’20). The departure of Building Commissioner Douglas Murrow in ’18, whose stringent policies and slow-moving approval procedures were a source of headaches for local developers, has already increased the ease of real estate construction and led to a record-high development pipeline. Approval of ~$3M in tax breaks for Lynx Venture’s proposed 165-unit building in the Downtown / The Fan submarket is emblematic of the city’s new pro-development policies. Revitalization efforts in the Scott’s Addition neighborhood and the Downtown / The Fan submarkets has attracted an influx of millennials. An attractive going-in yield slightly offset by below-average long-term NOI growth expectations results in a solid return profile for apartment investors.|Near-term population growth outpaces the top market average; retail sales growth should benefit|Relative affordability increases disposable income|Revitalization of Scott’s Addition neighborhood could help retain millennials that migrate to more desirable metros|Low population density weighs on foot traffic|Middle of the pack household incomes dependent on low-paying industries dampens overall spending power |Below-average occupancy highlights a weaker tenant profile mix
7|212|Mall|Sacramento|Sacramento: Fundamentals in Sacramento appear to be holding up nicely, with near-term M-RevPAF growth forecasted to outpace most top markets. As the Golden State capital, Sacramento benefits from strong and resilient employment in the public sector which has contributed to steady income growth over the last several years. The University submarket is likely to outperform others in Sacramento over the long term due to a denser population base and large presence of a younger renting cohort. As NIMBYism remains a significant impediment and lower rents make developments difficult to pencil, the supply pipeline is forecasted to remain relatively low. Though Sacramento struggles to compete with San Francisco and Silicon Valley for prominent tech interest, accelerating work from home trends could drive renter demand as employees are able to live further from their jobs and enjoy cheaper rents and  larger spaces. This trend has yet to fully play out and has room to run, thus long-term rent expectations in the market remain in line with the top markets. With high going-in yields relative to other California markets and healthy growth expectations, Sacramento boasts among the highest expected returns across the top markets. |Affluent populations in the Folsom and Roseville submarkets boost spending power in the market|Employment is concentrated in the resilient government and education / health services sectors |Recent in-migration trends keep retail sales growth expectations above average|Market is dominated by the Galleria at Roseville|Elevated vacancies persist; one notable anchor closure was Nordstrom at Arden Fair Mall in ’20|TAMI job growth has failed to catch momentum in the market, putting a limiting factor on income growth
7|213|Mall|Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City: Salt Lake City’s economy continues to diversify as companies from various sectors are drawn to the metro’s business-friendly environment and deep talent pool. A large portion of the market’s strong population growth is concentrated among younger age groups who are attracted to the lifestyle and job market, fueling demand for apartments in the CBD submarket due to the close proximity to many offices and the relatively urban, walkable location. Developers have responded to this demand with the construction of notable developments including The Block 67 project and The Exchange, which will add a combined ~1k units by ‘21. Many of these luxury apartments are highly amenitized developments targeting millennials and new residents, but ~80 apartments in The Exchange will be left for affordable housing. Developers will be able to keep the vast majority of units at market rates, though, as the Utah government did not pass a bill to give cities the choice to impose rent control in 1Q’20. The flood of supply in the market has dampened what would have been otherwise robust fundamentals the last three years, but favorable demand should be more than enough to absorb units that deliver over the next few years. Long-term NOI growth is aided by solid fiscal health and the metro’s relative desirability, and a high initial yield combined with a favorable growth outlook make for attractive potential long-term returns. |Increasing tourism drawn to the area for outdoor activities|Strong forward-looking job growth in high paying FIRE and TAMI sectors|Strong population growth given the market’s desirability (low crime, good fiscal health, decent cost of living)|Highly suburban nature results in low population density|Average retail sales growth given the market’s below average spending power PSF|Occupancy levels below market average signaling a weaker tenant mix with exposure to failing brands 
7|214|Mall|San Antonio|San Antonio: Despite recent positive demand trends, the San Antonio apartment sector continues to face fundamental pressure stemming from the region’s housing affordability and lack of supply barriers. The metro has been a beneficiary of the fracking boom which has increased job and population growth, and it has also seen an increase in higher paying health care jobs; significant investment has been made to improve / expand health care facilities. Four large military bases provide stability and promote economic activity. Current rent and occupancy remain depressed from a large wave of new deliveries that hit the market in ’16 and ’17 during the energy recession, but stable demand supported by its exposure to the military has caused near-term M-RevPAF growth forecasts to be among the best of the top markets. Supply pipelines remain large in the near-term, while longer term, low barriers to entry, low levels of human capital, and large pockets of crime / poverty contribute to San Antonio’s mediocre long-term NOI growth prospects. The northern submarkets are better positioned than their southern counterparts, with the Northeast submarket standing out as a cut above the rest given its superior demographics. In aggregate, San Antonio screens middle-of-the-pack as compared with the rest of the top apartment markets regarding return expectations.|Low mall supply per capita|Higher than average retail sales growth expectations driven by strong employment figures|High occupancy levels|Suppressed income growth from less competitive labor pool|Increasing millennial population may exacerbate ecommerce trends|Demographics along the southern submarkets drag average TAP score lower for the market
7|215|Mall|Inland Empire|Inland Empire: With rental rates and home prices in Los Angeles and Orange County among the highest in the nation, many have turned to the neighboring Inland Empire as a cheaper housing alternative which has resulted in strengthening apartment fundamentals for the metro. The region’s position as a prominent west coast logistics hub has created thousands of new jobs—resulting in above-average population growth—and continues to drive decent housing demand. Chino and Corona, the closest submarkets to LA and OC, have seen the strongest renter demand due to above-average income levels and rising home prices. Given a severe housing shortage and overall lack of affordability, in 2H’19 AB 1482 was enacted by Governor Newsom implementing statewide rent control for renewal offers on apartments that are older than 15 years. The law will be in effect from January ’20 through January ‘30. Additionally, Prop 21, a measure to amend the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, will appear on the November ’20 ballot (a similar ballot measure failed in ’18), reigniting fear amongst landlords that local governments may be able to enact more restrictive forms of rent control. On the supply front, development has been dormant for much of this cycle, with most new deliveries being garden-style multifamily units. Single-family affordability and low-wage job growth relative to other Southern California metros will be among the largest long-term headwinds for apartment owners versus most West Coast markets.|Lower cost of living compared to neighboring OC, LA, and SD markets |Strong demographics and pockets of affluence in Temecula and Chino|In-migration pattern and relative affordability boosts population|Job growth concentrated in lower-paying industries, often offering only temporary employment (e.g., construction) |Competes with nearby Southern California destination malls (e.g., South Coast Plaza, The Grove)|~18% of retail inventory in the market is shadow supply 
7|216|Mall|San Diego|San Diego: San Diego is consistently recognized as one of the most desirable places to live in the U.S. because of its pleasant climate, healthy demographics, and 70 miles of picturesque coastline. Fundamentals are supported by the strong university network that retains ~50% of students as full-time residents post-graduation, and home prices that remain unaffordable for recent graduates and most young families. The market is home to an array of headquarters including Sempra Energy and Qualcomm, along with a variety of employers that are drawn to San Diego’s talented workforce. New, highly amenitized supply growth is concentrated in the Downtown submarket, which has the lowest homeownership rate in San Diego at ~20%. San Diego has high supply constraints due to natural and legislative barriers. In Downtown San Diego, developers must comply with a 500-ft cap on buildings because of its close proximity to the airport. In 2H’19, AB 1482 was enacted by Governor Newsom implementing statewide rent control for renewal offers on apartments that are older than 15 years. The law will be in effect beginning January ’20 until January ‘30. Additionally, Prop 21, a measure to amend the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act will appear on the November ’20 ballot (a similar ballot measure failed in ’18), reigniting fear among landlords that local governments may be able to enact more restrictive forms of rent control. |Higher levels of discretionary spending from affluent demographics|High population density|A desirable climate supports open air retail shopping at places like Westfield UTC and Fashion Valley mall  |Muted job growth|High cost of living decreases spending power|Below average retail sales growth
7|217|Mall|San Francisco|San Francisco: As a top tech hub with exceptionally high income levels, stable employment forecasts and one of the most educated population bases in the country, San Francisco remains among the most expensive places to rent. San Francisco continues to be one of the most difficult cities to build in, with NIMBYism, as well as geographic and regulatory barriers to development, impeding new supply. Political risk remains significant in the market as California, especially as leaders in Los Angeles and San Francisco, continue to tilt more populist and implement new legislation accordingly. Though Prop 10 (repeal of Costa-Hawkins Act, which limits the scope of rent control) lost in ‘18, the passage of AB 1482 in the state of California (limits annual rent increases to 5%),  took effect in early ’20. Similar campaigns are likely to pop up over the next several years with the most notable one being another potential repeal of Costa-Hawkins revisiting the ballot in November ‘20. Despite developing legislative headwinds, San Francisco’s long-term rent growth is likely to outperform most top markets largely as a result of the regulatory constraints and strong human capital. Further, homeownership in the Bay Area remains out of reach for many, especially in San Francisco, where the median home price reaches >$1M. It is worth noting that as work from home trends accelerate and companies (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) formulate plans for at least a portion of employees to permanently work remote, San Francisco’s high exposure to the tech industry may become a growing concern. Though going-in yields are low, elevated long-term NOI growth projections boost San Francisco toward the top of our return expectations across the  top markets. |Elevated concentration of high-income earners |Healthy retail sales growth expectations|High population density|Extremely high cost of living weighs on consumer's bottom lines|Dense, affluent population primed for high ecommerce use weakens demand profile|Economic sensitivity to the technology industry increases volatility
7|218|Mall|San Jose|San Jose: Big tech firms and their educated and well-compensated workforce drove much of the success in the South Bay market over the last cycle. In late ‘19, Facebook and Google announced plans to expand their presences by a combined ~8M SF in San Jose, creating space for an additional ~35k employees in the market. With multiple companies, including Facebook, expressing plans to shift a portion of employees to remote work solutions permanently, it remains unclear what portion of these jobs will be in the office full time as the secular shift to working from home continues to play out. In an attempt to improve the Bay Area housing crisis, Facebook, Google, and Apple have each pledged $1B to build additional housing and keep further home price appreciation at bay. Additional infrastructure projects include the ~$5.5B Silicon Valley BART expansion which will connect Oakland to San Jose and allow the workforce to travel between the metros more easily. Though affordable housing initiatives have become seemingly ubiquitous across California, favorable regulatory barriers remain in place, limiting future market rate supply growth. . While San Jose had been a relative winner of migration trends throughout much of the last cycle, near-term population growth forecasts appear to be in line with our top market average stemming from uncertainty related to the work from home shift. Though going-in yields remain low, and near-term growth prospects are stunted, strong long-term growth forecasts contribute to healthy return expectations.|Healthy retail sales growth expectations|Affluent population with high disposable income|Strong employment growth forecast|City and state legislation becoming increasingly business-unfriendly|Population growth expected to slow in the near-term due to outmigration trends to cheaper metros|The affluent, tech-heavy market is more likely to adopt ecommerce, weakening the consumer's physical return to malls
7|219|Mall|Seattle|Seattle: The prominence of giant tech firms, including Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, continue to drive high-paying job growth to the region. Apartment fundamentals have greatly benefited from the rapid expansion of these tech companies as they compete for top talent in the metro. Just within the past year, Apple, Amazon, and Expedia have added a combined ~6,000 jobs to Seattle, primarily concentrated in the South Lake Union and Bellevue submarkets. Institutional capital interest in the region has ramped— and with it came a wave of new development. The South Lake Union, Bellevue, and Central submarkets, Seattle’s most expensive areas, are seeing the highest new supply, likely causing rent growth to slow as developments are completed. In addition, legislation was passed in ‘19 that will lower barriers to supply in several submarkets. Microsoft announced plans to invest $500M to provide affordable housing in the Kirkland, Bellevue, and Federal Way submarkets. Individuals looking for rent relief from Seattle’s most expensive areas are fueling new demand and boosting fundamentals in the submarkets of Everett, Kent, and Federal Way. Despite weakening demand from the impacts of the pandemic, Seattle’s long-term growth and return expectations are among the best relative to other coastal markets.  |Robust TAMI and FIRE growth in recent years; typically accompanied with higher-paying jobs|Stronger demographics relative to the top markets; significantly higher median household income|Healthy projected retail sales growth catalyzed by robust job growth in recent years|Escalating cost of living reduces disposable income|Increasing amount of anchor closures; 7 mall properties in Seattle have at least 1 vacant anchor|Amazon’s large and growing presence accelerates ecommerce penetration in the metro
7|220|Mall|St. Louis|St. Louis: Fundamentals in St. Louis remain uninspiring as the market’s high exposure to low-growth sectors, such as manufacturing and trade, have rendered the local economy a laggard in terms of GDP and employment growth relative to other Midwest markets. While supply barriers remain low with few regulatory or geographic constraints, low growth and minimal demand have kept new development at bay. Given the market’s poor performance amidst a tepid supply pipeline, this trend is worrisome for local owners. Employment growth, which had been sluggish throughout most of the last cycle, will likely prove even more troublesome as employment trends are expected to slow amid the ongoing recession. A bright spot for the region has been Boeing and GM’s continued investment in the market; Boeing’s regional workforce has expanded by 2k jobs over the last couple years and GM recently invested $1.5B into their Wentzville truck factory. It remains to be seen how Boeing’s ongoing 737 troubles, further exacerbated by the current pandemic which has significantly reduced travel demand, will impact local hiring. Further headwinds for the St. Louis apartment market include an aging and stagnant population base as well as very affordable single-family homes. Relatively high going-in yields offset weak intermediate and long-term growth forecasts which results in a return profile that is expected to be in line with our top market average.|Mixed-use development at City Foundry will add >20K SF of retail in 2Q’21, aiding below average retail sales growth|Pockets of relative affluence in Clayton and Manchester submarkets will aid in the rebound of durable goods sales|Established employers within the area, like Boeing and Walmart, add stability to local incomes|Most of the market’s malls are privately owned, lower-quality properties with quickly deteriorating fundamentals|Population growth will remain inert through ’25; the metro also sees low outside tourist traffic|Forecasted GDP growth (~1.3% through ‘25) gives muted outlook for economic development 
7|225|Mall|Tampa-St. Petersburg|Tampa-St. Petersburg: Tampa’s strong population growth is largely driven by retirees, which tempers otherwise bright fundamentals. Law firm Baker McKenzie will open an innovation hub that will bring ~300 jobs to the Central Tampa submarket, and the health and life science research presence around the Moffitt Cancer Center continues to grow with Swedish biotech company Vycellix choosing Tampa for its U.S HQ. Supply growth in Tampa surpasses the top market average with new deliveries centered in the Central Tampa and Central St. Petersburg submarkets. In Central Tampa, investors should be wary of Midtown Tampa and Water Street, 2 mixed-use developments currently under construction that will bring ~1.7k units to the submarket. While traditionally a favorite for its healthy demographics, the Southwest Tampa submarket is also facing more supply. The Westshore Marina District has started construction and will add >1k apartments and condos, retail space, and a marina to the Southwest submarket. With an economy driven by local services and overall less sensitive to Covid-19 risk, Tampa is expected to perform well over the next 5 years, resulting in above-average M-RevPAF growth expectations. Over the long term, Tampa’s population growth and status as a desirable coastal market mitigate the effects of oversupply to support healthy long-term NOI growth for Tampa apartments.|Retail sales growth through ‘25 is expected to grow faster than market average on the back of an older demographic|Labor fundamentals and an older population will keep sales productivity high through durable good purchases|Investment in transportation in Hillsborough County and Interstate 275 in ’21 will increase retail accessibility|Tourism spending will likely remain a headwind for retail as tourism within the state saw a ~30% contraction in ‘20|Household income distribution tilts towards lower earners, hindering luxury retail segment|Current mall occupancy lags Sun Belt average as supply per capita screens significantly higher than top markets
7|1264|Mall|Honolulu|Honolulu: As one of the world’s top tourist destinations, the Honolulu economy primarily relies on the leisure and hospitality sectors which have faced large recent headwinds due to Covid-19. The island’s isolated location and high-cost environment make it difficult for businesses to justify moving into the market, leading to limited employment growth in other sectors. The ever-rising cost of living has led to population declines in recent years, and much of the loss has been concentrated in the 34-and-below age group. Despite these negative tailwinds, limited supply insulates apartment fundamentals on the island. The strict entitlement and permitting processes, along with high land prices, make development time consuming and pricey. To make up for affordability issues on the island, the local government is working to ease supply barriers. Recent legislation (Bill 7) was approved in ‘19 in hopes of encouraging the development of more affordable housing for Honolulu residents. The new law allows higher density apartments to be built on lots of <20k SF in exchange for requirements to charge rates deemed affordable on at least 80% of the units. Douglas Emmett is also in the process of converting a ~490k SF office building into ~500 apartment units over the next few years in the Central Honolulu submarket. An unclear outlook for the Honolulu economy, out-migration, and easing supply barriers call for intermediate-term growth to remain among the lowest of the top markets, hindering the island’s risk-adjusted return expectations. |Sales productivity is among the best of the top markets; bolstered by tourist spending in the long-term|Low ecommerce penetration due to 3-7 day shipping versus 1-2 day shipping on the mainland|“A” malls (~75% of stock) should recover quickly once international tourism resumes|The economy’s reliance on the hospitality sector (~40% of jobs) has proven to be a risk|Near-term retail sales growth is expected to be among the lowest of the top markets|Cost of living among the highest of the top markets weakens spending power for residents
7|1282|Mall|Columbus|Columbus: While the capital of Ohio is economically outperforming its Midwest peers, decelerating job growth in the FIRE and TAMI sectors coupled with a lack of supply barriers limit long-term prospects for Columbus. The city’s strengths lie in the large presence of Fortune 500 companies that have helped attract young talent and greatly contributed to the metro’s economic growth. Ohio State University, one of the largest universities in the U.S., also provides a strong base of educated professionals (~40% of graduates stay in Columbus). Developers have been actively adding new supply to the metro as strong in-migration and business expansions have increased apartment demand. Most of the new supply is concentrated in the University / Downtown submarket, where demand for mixed-use space has accelerated. If job growth continues to meaningfully decline in high-paying industries, the significant supply pipeline may dampen future apartment fundamentals, especially as the long-term effects of Covid-19 are felt. Investors should also be wary of affordable single-family housing placing a cap on rent growth. Overall, Columbus’ educated workforce and millennial population are helping apartment demand, but low barriers to entry limit long-term NOI growth and return expectations.	|Lower cost of living increases disposable income|Stronger fundamentals relative to Midwest peers in terms of job and population growth forecasts|Low retail supply per capita|Outmigration of high-paying industries (e.g., TAMI) limits income growth |Low household incomes, particularly in the Downtown submarket, dampen spending power |Inclement weather increases capital expenditures for asset owners 
7|1316|Mall|Dallas / Fort Worth|Dallas / Fort Worth: The sprawling DFW metro has many strong demand drivers but is still susceptible to large waves of new supply. DFW continues to be an attractive business destination as employers are drawn to the region’s business-friendly environment, affordability, and centralized location, and the quality of job growth has improved in recent years with higher paying finance and tech job growth gaining momentum.  Low physical and regulatory barriers to entry have resulted in inflated supply pipelines and a deluge of new deliveries. These units are being matched with robust demand, resulting in average intermediate-term M-RevPAF growth forecasts. Long-term NOI growth is negatively impacted by the ease with which new supply can be added to the market. A significant portion of new supply is focused in the northern neighborhoods of Plano / Frisco and in the University Park submarket. Given current pricing and the healthy intermediate outlook, returns are expected to be around the top market average. |Strong retail sales growth forecast aided by above average population growth in the near-term|Significant rebound in employment compared to the rest of the country in ‘20|Lower mall supply per capita stabilizes near-term headwinds|Roughly a third of malls have low productivity, creating challenges during economic recovery|Muted income growth relative to top market average|Growing millennial population will shift consumer habits (ecommerce)
7|1521|Mall|D.C. Metro|D.C. Metro: D.C. Metro apartment fundamentals have lagged most major markets this cycle, though prospects are improving in the near term, the stability of public sector hiring should lead to a shallower trough in apartment rents and occupancy versus other coastal markets. Over the intermediate term, a highly-educated labor force and positive momentum on the TAMI job growth front bode well for apartment fundamentals. Amazon’s move to Crystal City will likely prove a win for local apartment owners as the firm will attract an influx of highly compensated employees. The new jobs associated with HQ2, which in total represent a 10% expansion of tech jobs for the market, are likely to be phased in over the course of ~10 years. Along with Crystal City, the Southwest Waterfront and Nationals Park neighborhoods continue to be hotbeds for new Class A product. Supply growth is expected to remain steady over the coming years, preventing a meaningful re-acceleration in rent growth (similar to most markets). As the pandemic exacerbates many large state and city deficits that will likely require significant tax hikes to resolve (e.g., NYC and NJ), D.C. stands to benefit as one of the few gateway markets not burdened by poor fiscal health. Uncertainty around government spending may continue to be a headwind for the area, but the D.C.

9|150|Office|Atlanta|Atlanta: Atlanta’s pro-business environment continues to attract companies and drive steady job growth within the metro. In 3Q'19, BlackRock announced that its new innovation center will bring >1k tech jobs to the Northeast submarket, beginning in ’20. Google expanded its presence in Midtown in 4Q'19 while Microsoft announced its new Atlanta office, which will bring ~1.5k jobs to Midtown, in 2Q’20. The Midtown submarket, offering a walkable lifestyle adjacent to Georgia Tech, has garnered significant attention from developers with ~2k apartment units under construction. While overall supply growth in Atlanta is in line with the top market average, the Gwinnet submarket has seen outsized development. Cumberland and Buckhead remain favorable due to their relatively muted supply pipelines and strong demographics; Buckhead continues to attract millennials with its walkability, strong transport systems, and cultural amenities while residents seeking suburban living flock to the Cumberland submarket, located only 20 minutes from Downtown. Traffic congestion and poor infrastructure are still problematic across the metro, although the city and state plan to invest $2.5B to improve MARTA lines and offerings over the next 25 years. With healthy employment growth and an increasing tech presence, Atlanta boasts a strong long-term outlook and near-term M-RevPAF growth that bests most top markets.|Emory University, Georgia Tech, and the University of Georgia provide skilled labor pool|TAMI (technology, advertising, media, information) job growth significantly outpaced Sun Belt average from ‘15 to ‘20|Improvements in city infrastructure starting in ’21 expected to enhance intra-city accessibility|Office leasing activity in Midtown is TAMI concentrated – the employment sector with the fastest WFH utilization|Rapid development expected through ’25 with ~3M SF of office space under construction in Midtown|Historical office occupancy has been low; with recent spikes in releasing activity in Midtown suggesting excess supply
9|151|Office|Austin|Austin: Strong asset value appreciation for Austin apartments has been driven by robust demand from both employment and population growth. Austin has become a major tech hub and destination for skilled, young workers that is fueled by a deep talent pool from local universities, a vibrant culture, and relative affordability. Upcoming expansion plans by brand-name employers bode well for job growth momentum. Apple’s $1 billion campus development  will bring 15k new jobs in the area by ’22. Facebook, Google, and Oracle, and now Tesla are also expanding their presence in the metro. This population boom has caused once-affordable home prices to surge, giving apartment owners more room to push rents. Rental demand anchored by the millennial cohort has been focused in the Downtown / Northwest submarkets, and the area around The Domain. New development has also been concentrated in these areas. The supply pipeline remains elevated, but demand is expected to allow for above-average M-RevPAF growth. Barriers to entry in Austin, while less than coastal markets, are the highest in Texas which will help support long-term rent growth. There is also growing evidence of NIMBYism in the area as residents and the city council have expressed concerns over increased traffic and rapidly rising home prices. Strong fundamentals, coupled with relatively attractive cap rates compared to markets with similar growth, drive attractive risk-adjusted returns.|Venture capital activity and tech labor pool is drawing more startups here; more affordable ecosystem (vs. SF)|Austin’s pro-business climate attracts corporate relocations and expansions (Tesla, Apple, Google, etc.)|Quality of life and affordability drives above-average job growth expectations|Lack of adequate public transportation results in higher population density around the Downtown and Central submarkets|Above-average supply growth driven by increased development activity in the CBD|Industry concentration poses risk as TAMI businesses offer workers more flexibility to work remote
9|152|Office|Baltimore|The Baltimore market remains an intriguing option for investors shying away from the increasingly modest going-in yields presented by other East Coast markets. Fueled by growth in the information and professional services sectors, future economic growth in Baltimore is likely to outpace that of many of its Eastern seaboard peers. Notably, a strengthening high-tech sector largely comprised of cybersecurity firms continues to spill over from the neighboring D.C. Metro, bolstered by a highly skilled local workforce and the presence of major universities such as Johns Hopkins and the University of Maryland. Various suburbs intend to reap the benefits of this wave of cybersecurity growth; the Merriweather District development hopes to create a “center of gravity in the cyberspace community” while transforming the landscape of downtown Columbia. Such development is not limited to suburbs, however, as the massive Port Covington project seeks to breathe new life into Baltimore City. Despite such efforts over the long term, current headwinds include high crime rates and severely entrenched urban poverty, rendering Baltimore City a less attractive region in which to live and work. Higher cap rates may attract some yield-oriented investors, but poor intermediate-term growth and a fairly restrained long-term outlook should be a drag on returns. |Prevalence of major research institutions and defense firms provides floor for office demand|Proximity to National Security Agency and other agencies at Fort Meade attracts cybersecurity firms|University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins provide employer access to a highly skilled talent pool|Below-average population / employment growth expectations relative to national top markets|Increasing subleasing activity and Class A vacancies in 2H’20 negatively impact pricing power|Below-average Desirability Index hinders ability to attract talent
9|154|Office|Boston|Boston: The market continues to attract an outsized share of knowledge-based workers as employers are drawn to a well-educated population anchored by a top university system. Employers like Amazon, Foundation Medicine, Klaviyo, and Google are expanding in or relocating to Boston, bringing thousands of high-paying jobs to the metro. Millennial population continues to grow as recent graduates chase these high-paying jobs. In addition to in-migration, apartment demand is supported by some of the highest home prices across top markets, delaying homeownership for many renters. A healthy demand backdrop combined with an average supply pipeline will help the city overcome short-term struggles brought on by the pandemic, leaving Boston among the strongest gateway markets for intermediate growth potential. Healthy demand can be found in Boston’s downtown submarkets given a desirable lifestyle and proximity to work. Investors should be aware of the “Imagine Boston 2030” master plan and its aim to make the market more affordable by ‘30 through increased mixed-use development which will add apartment inventory to the metro. Solid long-term growth prospects, should provide investors with attractive risk-adjusted returns relative to most metros.|Strong university system and high levels of educational attainment attract employers to the metro|Demand bolstered by the growing life science industry; 7 of the 10 largest biotech firms have a presence in Cambridge|Suburban submarkets may experience occupancy tailwinds as companies look to leave the urban core|With below-average population growth and a greater propensity to WFH, market is more susceptible to WFH trends|Cap rates among the lowest of the top markets hinder long-term return expectations|Current inventory growth above average; ~2M SF under construction in the Seaport District submarket
9|156|Office|New Jersey (Central)|New Jersey (Central): The Central New Jersey apartment market has proven a stable but low-growth market this past cycle. The long-term outlook remains underwhelming due to concerning fiscal health trends and sluggish employer growth. The state’s “Grow NJ” program, which provided tax incentives for companies that created or retained jobs in the region, had little success in Central New Jersey and finally expired in July ’19. The state’s concerning fiscal health (debt burden >$200B), which will likely be much worse following Covid-19, should deter investors as property tax increases to raise government funds would cut directly into the bottom line. Green Street estimates that a ~700 bp increase to the median resident’s non-federal tax burden is required to offset the state’s unfunded liabilities, which translates to an ~8% decline in after-tax income. Princeton University’s younger demographic provides steady rental demand for landlords in the Mercer / Princeton submarket, but the metro struggles to keep graduates from relocating to surrounding metros with better job prospects (e.g., New York, D.C., Boston). Stagnant population growth has pressured investors’ ability to push rents, and millennial out-migration forecasts will likely continue to weigh on long-term demand.|Continued growth in life science industry drives demand in Princeton and New Brunswick|Strong university system and high human capital attractive for employers|High going-in yields bolster returns|Younger population drawn to more desirable metros|Lack of demand from large corporations|Poor fiscal health weighs on long-term growth
9|158|Office|Charlotte|Charlotte: Strong domestic in-migration and employment growth have provided nice tailwinds for apartment fundamentals. Young adults have flocked to North Carolina’s most populous metro, drawn by Charlotte’s diverse range of employment opportunities, relative affordability compared to other East Coast hubs, and a dynamic live / work / play environment. The quality of job growth has improved in recent years, fueled by the array of employers that operate in Charlotte and those that are choosing to expand in the market (e.g., Lowe’s, U.S. Bank, Honeywell). Developers have been active and there has been a focus on mixed-use development along the LYNX Blue Line metro, with a new delivery at seemingly every stop. In 4Q’19, Charlotte’s City Council voted to spend $50M for a transportation firm to design a 26-mile Silver Line light-rail connecting the East submarket to Uptown and westward into Gaston County, despite ongoing concerns about how the city will fund the ~$4B project. As competition for tenants increases, landlords have been forced to offer more amenitized space to differentiate their product. Supply growth across the metro is showing no signs of slowing, and though absorption has been healthy investors should remain cautious of the elevated supply pipeline over the next 5 years, especially if economic growth remains sluggish in the next few years. Demand in Midtown and Downtown should stack up favorably as young adults have demonstrated a strong propensity to rent in these submarkets. |Working age population expected to grow ~2.5x the Sun Belt average through ’25, aided by strong FIRE sector|Strong corporate allure as a result of corporate tax environment and university strength / adjacency to UNC|Commentary from BofA, employer of ~16k Charlotte employees, suggests less WFH utilization for FIRE tenants|Insufficient LYNX light rail system / transportation infrastructure, above-average commute times into CBD|Less educated workforce outside of Midtown and southern submarkets pressures longer term market effective rent|Supply to increase by ~10% of current stock through ’22, Legacy Union added ~200k SF of speculative CBD space in ‘20
9|160|Office|Chicago|Chicago: The “Capital of the Midwest” exhibits stronger near-term apartment fundamentals than nearby Midwest markets, but Chicago still suffers from concerning long-term demographic and fiscal health trends. Owners are pressured by increasing tax liabilities from reassessed property values as the city / state try to alleviate fiscal woes. Additionally, a November ’20 ballot measure proposes graduated individual income tax rates between 4.95%-7.99%, changing from a current fixed rate of 4.95%. While increasing taxes hurts disposable income and has contributed to some out-migration, the modest silver lining is limited new supply in the market since developers are hesitant of the metro’s higher taxes and rising construction costs. Investors should be aware of the $6B Lincoln Yards master plan, which will phase in ~6k apartment units to the Lincoln Park / Old Town submarket over the intermediate term. In addition to fiscal issues, the metro suffers from millennial out-migration and unattractive employment trends, losing share to markets with higher-paying job opportunities. The wealthy population that resides in the Glencoe / Wilmette submarket, which falls outside of city limits (and thus outside of Chicago’s fiscal issues), pay some of the highest nominal rents across the market. Landlords have been able to consistently push rent in this submarket despite overall metro headwinds.|Diverse industry base; growing momentum in life sciences|Educated labor pool and strong university system|CBD submarkets should see outsized long-term rent growth potential relative to the rest of the market|Covid catalyzing work from home trends – may especially impact urban markets|Lincoln Yards development to deliver ~7M SF of office supply to North submarket  through ’23|Troubled city / state finances; rising tax environment
9|161|Office|Cincinnati|Cincinnati: Cincinnati’s growth is broadly driven by its exposure to a few large corporate headquarters, including Kroger, Proctor & Gamble, and Macy’s. While large companies have helped propel job growth this last cycle, primarily in the finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE) sectors, a troubled manufacturing industry and lackluster population growth will likely weigh on apartment demand. Proximity to Columbus’ more stable job market hurts Cincinnati’s ability to attract young talent and prevent millennials from migrating. Very affordable single-family housing has also resulted in one of the highest homeownership rates relative to the top markets, which limits an investor’s ability to push apartment rents. One positive for the metro is Proctor and Gamble’s and Kroger’s strong quarterly earnings and forward-guidance in late ‘19, both of whom were facing challenges over the past few years. Despite an encouraging trajectory early in the year for P&G and Kroger, Covid-19 has disrupted future hiring plans for two of Cincinnati’s largest employers. In addition, Macy’s plans to slash ~3,900 corporate and management jobs as part of a restructuring plan will likely further dampen apartment fundamentals. Limited demand tailwinds, affordable homes, underwhelming demographics, and lagging population growth restrict the metro’s long-term NOI growth potential.	|Relatively low pandemic related unemployment will aid the local economy and job market in recovery|Improved job growth in office-using sectors such as professional and business services|A lack of corporate income tax makes it a business-friendly market that attracts employers to the area|Outflow of working age population is forecasted in the intermediate-term|Weak university system fails to attract highly educated talent to the area  |Outsized reliance on struggling industries such as manufacturing
9|162|Office|Cleveland|Cleveland: A lack of young talent and weak job growth point to a continuation of poor apartment fundamentals. Once a manufacturing powerhouse, Cleveland has failed to redefine itself as globalization and technological innovation continue to leave many Rust Belt cities behind. The city suffers from significant out-migration, which is expected to continue over the next 5 years led by a decline in young adults who are relocating for better opportunities. Cleveland’s lone bright spot and best hope for reversing momentum remains in health care. The Case Western Reserve University Medical School and the Cleveland Clinic are large providers of high-paying jobs and economic activity. Investments in the life sciences is underway at the Cleveland Clinic’s research centers that may help generate some growth. However, it remains doubtful that the health care sector’s job growth in isolation will be able to resuscitate the local economy.  The Downtown submarket is demonstrating emerging strength due to a modernization effort by the Downtown Cleveland Alliance to create an innovation district. Despite development initiatives to generate an increasingly vibrant downtown area, Cleveland still struggles to compete with more desirable Midwest markets.	|A tax friendly environment improves local business fundamentals|Steady health care job inflow supports demand for space|Recent efforts to revitalize the CBD should aid in strengthening fundamentals|Outflow of high-paying, office-using jobs in the TAMI and FIRE industries|Negative long-term NOI growth forecasts driven by low Desirability and Human Capital scores|Population outflow for many years and forecasted through ’25 bring grim growth prospects
9|166|Office|Dallas|Dallas: Dallas continues to be an attractive destination for businesses and employees. Companies are drawn to the region because of the business-friendly environment, affordability, and centralized location. This trend is best exemplified by Core-Mark (CORE) making the decision to move from San Francisco to Dallas in 1Q’19, citing cost savings and Dallas’s strategic location as key drivers. In addition to diverse job opportunities, residents are also attracted to the area’s affordability and lifestyle. The spread between mortgage payments and rent continues to widen as home price appreciation outpaces rent growth. This trend could be a major tailwind for apartment demand since single-family affordability has restrained M-RevPAF growth in the area historically. Another factor impeding M-RevPAF growth is an overabundance of supply that is fueled by pro-development policies and low-barriers to entry across the market. Currently, Dallas has one of the largest supply pipelines in the country, with a bulk of the new supply focused in the northern neighborhoods of Plano / Frisco. Elevated supply should cause M-RevPAF growth to lag the top market average in the intermediate term, despite a strong demand outlook.|Low tax, business-friendly environment|Large Fortune 500 presence|Relative affordability|Low barriers to entry|Above-average vacancy rates|Shallow pool of tech talent
9|168|Office|Denver|Denver: Denver continues to attract jobs from a diverse set of employment bases. YoY TAMI job growth  has been trending at an average of ~4% each month since the beginning of ’19. TAMI growth is supported by the in-migration of several startups and small tech firms, along with tech giants such as Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, and Apple. High-quality job opportunities, coupled with Denver’s desirable quality of life and access to nature, have attracted many young residents, making “The Mile-High City” a hot spot for millennial migration. Millennial demand has skyrocketed in trendy neighborhoods such as the LoHi / Highlands neighborhood in the Golden / Wheatridge submarket, and the RiNo Arts District in the Northeast submarket. Demand in the Downtown submarket is bolstered by the walkable, urban environment. Continued interest from affluent, highly-compensated millennials in these submarkets should allow for strong rent growth potential. The market’s low initial investment yields are offset by solid long-term growth, driving above-average risk-adjusted returns.|Economy driven by office using employment in the TAMI and expanding FIRE sectors|High concentration of young, working-age population |Deep talent pool from local universities like University of Denver and CU Boulder|WFH utilization among the highest in the nation|Development continues around Downtown; Block162 delivered 600k SF of spec office space in CBD late ‘20|Exposure to turbulent energy industry increases market volatility 
9|169|Office|Detroit|Detroit: Optimism in the “Motor City” is fading as employment figures weaken and investment in the market is failing to provide substantial and sustainable improvement. Economic growth is expected to lag the rest of the Midwest through the intermediate term, even with substantial investments from billionaire Dan Gilbert and national automotive companies. The metro is hindered by continued dependence on stagnating industries and fails to make a meaningful economic shift toward higher-growth industries. TAMI jobs have seen consistent net outflow for years, and overall employment growth in Detroit ranks among the lowest across top markets (~35% of the population lives below the poverty line). The lack of well-paying jobs hampers in-migration as new graduates and millennials choose more desirable markets that offer better compensation to start their careers. Tepid demand from minimal population and job growth mixed with low supply barriers provide a weak intermediate-term outlook for the apartment sector. Additionally, rising construction costs are leading developers to rethink their plans or ditch them all together as rents cannot keep up with increasing development costs. This is exemplified in projects like the East Jefferson Meijer, originally planned as a 213-unit mixed-use apartment / small-format grocer development that was abandoned in favor of a larger-format grocery store and parking lot. While the market has improved substantially since its bankruptcy in ‘13, the outlook still looks bleak.|Substantial investment (~$5.6B) by Daniel Gilbert of Bedrock to revitalize the CBD|In 3Q’20, AMZN announced the addition of ~100 employees in its downtown building|Clearcover, an auto insurance provider, announced plans in 3Q’20 to invest ~$5M in office space, creating ~300 jobs|Inability to meaningfully diversify from its economic dependence on the automotive / manufacturing industry|Without the necessary acceleration towards high-growth sectors, like TAMI, office demand should remain dismal|Lack of employment and population growth, especially among younger talent
9|170|Office|District of Columbia|District of Columbia: D.C. apartment fundamentals have remained steady thanks to decent business / professional services job growth, which has offset the stagnating government, finance, and information sectors. The metro has also seen increased hiring in the stable education and health services sectors. Several revitalization projects are currently underway that will reshape the metro, including Phase I of The Wharf, an urban renewal of D.C.’s southwest waterfront that opened in ’17. Phase II will bring an additional 1.15M SF of mixed-use development, slated to deliver by ’22. In November ‘18, Amazon announced that it will officially split its coveted HQ2 location between Crystal City, VA and Long Island City, NY, with each region gaining ~25K jobs. The announcement, which capitivated the attention of institutional investors, is widely viewed as a win for D.C. apartment operators who stand to benefit from an influx of highly-compensated employees.  While the metro’s affluent demographics and high cost of homeownership will continue to support apartment fundamentals, D.C. is also facing millennial out-migration. Strong millennial demand for rentals originally fueled D.C.’s apartment frenzy, but since ’15, out-migration has outpaced in-migration, which is a trend that is expected to persist and will serve as a future demand headwind for operators.|Gentrification of SW Waterfront as live / work / play hub|Steady leasing in non-CBD submarkets|Abundance of local universities / research facilities|Volatility in government budget / employment|Competition from more affordable submarkets in Suburban VA / MD|Trend of millennial out-migration
9|171|Office|Fairfield County|Fairfield County: Statewide fiscal concerns and tepid job growth continue to suppress apartment fundamentals in Fairfield County. Outsized municipal debt and unfunded liabilities have forced higher tax rates, a major determinant for several corporate HQ departures over the past few years (e.g., GE to Boston, Starwood to Miami). Fairfield County has not been able to attract any large relocations to backfill those gaps left behind. Meanwhile, the metro continues to face the headwinds of a shift from active to passive investment management, though FIRE employment improved in '18 after 22 consecutive months of YoY job declines. The market serves as a suburban living alternative to Manhattan which attracts more families looking to live in homes than rent apartments. Millennial population growth continues to decelerate as more prefer to live closer to Manhattan-based jobs.  While limited new construction will support apartment rent growth, unfavorable demographics and fiscal health issues should handcuff long-term NOI growth.|Affluent population; high income|Proximity to NYC creates some spillover demand|Limited new supply|Concerning state fiscal health|Inability to attract new high caliber employers|Tax reform is bad for the highest earners; possible outmigration
9|172|Office|Fort Lauderdale|Fort Lauderdale: Moderate job and population growth paired with middle-of-the-pack supply growth create a mixed outlook for Fort Lauderdale apartments. While tourism has historically been the primary economic growth driver, Fort Lauderdale’s economy is diversifying with a promising life sciences sector and steady job growth in the FIRE and professional / business services industries. The Fort Lauderdale, Plantation, and Miramar / Pembroke Pines submarkets have seen the most supply as developers seek opportunity north of Miami. Las Olas Boulevard in the Fort Lauderdale submarket has attracted significant development due to its walkable lifestyle and downtown feel. Las Olas Walk, a mixed-use development, will add ~1,200 luxury rental units to the submarket by late '20. For favorable demographics and a limited supply pipeline, investors should look to the Davie submarket, which boasts the wealthiest and most educated residents in the metro.  While Fort Lauderdale’s coastal location and steady job growth support a healthy rent profile, the market’s outlook is moderated by condo oversupply in the near term and a lack of meaningful supply barriers over the long term. |Business-friendly environment (lack of a state income tax, low corporate taxes)|GFLA attracted Bankers Healthcare, a financial services firm, and Shiji, a tech company, to the metro in ’20|Desirable climate and lifestyle have made the metro a top spot for relocation during Covid-19 pandemic|Limited Fortune 500 presence|~1.3M SF of office space under development, largely in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood submarkets|Corporate airline and cruise presence at risk from Covid-19 pandemic
9|177|Office|Houston|Houston: After being impacted heavily by the energy bust in ’15, Houston’s economy is still recovering. A silver lining of the energy recession is a slightly more diversified economy; the health care sector has seen growth, exemplified by Texas Medical Center becoming the world’s largest medical complex. Petrochemical manufacturing and other downstream energy activities have also experienced outsized growth. Although Houston has diversified its economy in recent years, the 1Q’20 collapse in oil prices and Covid-19 pandemic have presented additional challenges for the market. A large amount of supply was delivered directly into the energy recession and is still being absorbed by the market, as evidenced by below-average occupancy rates. Now, given the current uncertain economic environment, the already-present vacancy rate troubles will likely be prolonged. The current supply pipeline, while not massive, is large enough to continue to put downward pressure on intermediate-term M-RevPAF growth. A lack of zoning laws and a sprawling metroplex provide little regulatory or physical barriers to entry, suppressing long-term growth. Investors should look west towards the Montrose / River Oaks and Museum submarkets where there are higher incomes, more expensive housing, and elevated rents, but in aggregate expect below-average long-term returns, as higher going in yields are offset by lackluster long-term NOI growth potential.|Low corporate income tax rates are attractive for corporate relocations – HPE most recently|Good fiscal health, allowing for major investments in local infrastructure such as transportation projects (e.g., NHHIP)|Local government remains active in pursuing economic initiatives that target employment growth|Increased sublease availability from the energy sector; high cash flow volatility due to industry concentration|Office supply glut pressuring occupancy rates across all submarkets|Lower percentage of college degrees makes the talent pool less competitive
9|178|Office|Indianapolis|Indianapolis: The capital of the “Hoosier State” has little to offer apartment investors in terms of long-term rent growth, as structural headwinds stemming from poor demographics and minimal supply constraints create a challenging environment. The job growth occurring is largely seen in the warehouse and manufacturing sectors which, combined with an outflow of high-paying TAMI jobs, limits income growth potential. While a quicker Covid-19 recovery is expected in Indianapolis over the next few years, the market should revert to below-average long-term growth relative to other top markets. Rent growth is constrained by affordable homeownership options available throughout the metro, and despite low regulatory and physical barriers, supply growth screens below average. Most of the development occurring in the metro can be found in the Downtown and Southwest submarkets. Meanwhile, the surrounding suburban submarkets exhibit the highest median incomes in the metro and have had more success in attracting investors (e.g., Spruce Capital, who purchased a ~1k unit suburban portfolio in early ’20). Though strong intermediate-term growth and high going-in yields screen attractive on the surface, affordable home prices allow renters to quickly transition into homeowners, hurting long-term rent growth potential.|Growth of education and health services sector classifies the market as economically stable|Low corporate tax rates|Low unemployment rate forecasts compared to other Midwest markets|Outflow of TAMI sector jobs expected to continue|Reliance on industries with minimal office space needs (e.g., manufacturing)|Low supply barriers limit rent growth potential
9|179|Office|Jacksonville|Jacksonville: While healthy population and job growth bode well for apartment demand in Jacksonville, supply growth concerns weigh heavily on long-term rent growth potential. The Southside submarket is seeing the bulk of oncoming supply as it has both cheap land for development and is home to a younger and more educated population. The Arlington and Downtown submarkets are also seeing significant supply growth, particularly as the city and developers try to revitalize downtown to attract and retain more residents.  Notable developments include the District, a $600M mixed-use development on the Southbank that will add ~1k residential units, a hotel, and a marina to the metro. Near the Southbank, San Marco is seeing substantial development with ~800 units to be added by '21. Investors should look to the Beaches submarket, which benefits from the market’s highest rents and limited supply along the coast. Strong population and employment growth will help Jacksonville weather the upcoming recession reasonably well, leading to above-average near-term M-RevPAF growth; however, the lack of any meaningful barriers to supply outside of the coast restrains long-term rent growth potential.   |Favorable corporate tax environment and low business costs serve as catalysts for occupier in-migration|Distance to CBD / commute times, particularly in western submarkets drives office market appeal|Development expected to be below Sun Belt average through ’25, with no new supply growth expected in CBD through ‘21|Office using employment from ’16-’20 underperformed Sun Belt through anemic TAMI sector|Poor human capital score outside of the Beaches and Baymeadows submarkets limits corporate activity within the metro|Weak population density / expectations for millennial population to contract through ’25 hampers demand
9|180|Office|Kansas City|Kansas City: A shallower trough in Covid-induced job losses versus most markets and solid expected intermediate growth are bright spots for Kansas City, but the metro’s longer-term return prospects continue to be hampered by structural headwinds. While the market’s supply pipeline remains below-average, new units will likely struggle to be absorbed in the face of subpar income and population growth. Employers such as the USDA and CarMax have chosen to establish new operations within the market, attracted by low costs of living and doing business. Existing companies such as Cerner, Garmin, and Burns McDonnel have all announced that they are expanding their footprint in the metro with plans to add over 18k combined jobs in the next few years (~3% expansion of the existing non-farm workforce). While hiring by these companies and efforts to improve local transportation infrastructure may help the metro recover from the Covid-19 fallout more quickly over the intermediate term, the metro’s continued inability to draw high-paying employers results in unfavorable long-term growth, driving below-average risk-adjusted returns.|Steady growth from office-using employers; business services will drive nearly 1/3 of GDP growth|Low commute times overall; the city has a strong connecting network of highways|The Power and Light District in Downtown adds desirable mixed-use office space and centralizes live / work in DT|Low barriers to supply as well as tax incentives to develop|Existing university system leaves a need for new talent in the market|Low Fortune 500 presence; T-Mobile / Sprint merger calls into question major employer (~6k legacy Sprint employees)
9|182|Office|Las Vegas|Las Vegas: Above-average job growth has bolstered Las Vegas apartment fundamentals in recent years, but this trend has dramatically reversed with Covid-19’s outsized hit on the hospitality and leisure industries. The market now faces all-time high levels of unemployment, among the worst of the top markets. The economy’s heavy reliance on the tourism and hospitality industries has proven to be an extreme risk, and its health will greatly depend on the future progression of the virus and the availability of a vaccine. Though jobs are expected to return in the future, and the Allegiant Stadium completion is expected to create ~1.2k new jobs, apartment demand will continue to face long-term fundamental headwinds created by a cheap single-family market that incentivizes homeownership and lower-paying job growth. As residents continue to migrate from California, many immediately look at investing in a home as housing prices are very affordable relative to the high-cost, West Coast markets. A strong focus on single family development has kept apartment supply in check, a positive for owners, but very low going-in yields combined with an uncertain path of recovery over the long-term limit investors’ return potential.|No corporate or personal state income tax has created a pro-business environment|Access to an international airport allows for convenient business travel|High going-in yields allow for above-average return potential|Growth in the TAMI and FIRE sectors has failed to gain momentum in recent years|Low supply barriers; ~500k SF of office will deliver in the Southwest submarket in ’21 in the Uncommons development|Relatively weaker talent pool with low levels of educational attainment and a weak university system
9|185|Office|Long Island|Long Island: After underwhelming job growth through much of the recent upcycle, Long Island’s local economy was one of the worst performers among the top  markets following the onset of the recession. The health care and education sectors, which have historically been a bright spot for job growth, experienced net declines throughout 1H’20, though the metro’s large government sector (~15% of jobs) held up relatively well. Long Island’s apartment demand generally benefits from New York City spillover, but this effect may be limited in the near term as the city grapples with economic fallout from the pandemic. It remains to be seen if tech growth in NYC will continue at its recent pace given the city’s fiscal issues and the acceleration in working from home, but already-announced expansions in ’19 (e.g., Google, Facebook, and Amazon) will provide incremental apartment demand. However, this will largely be confined to NYC’s urban core and Long Island submarkets in close proximity to Manhattan (i.e., Hempstead). Nearly 30% of Long Island’s population is between the ages of 45-64, among the highest across the top markets. As such, the region will likely never be a top destination for apartment investors due to its older, homeowning demographic, but a light supply pipeline should mitigate the job loss impact on rent growth to an extent.|Submarkets closer to NYC (e.g., Hempstead, East Nassau) may see spillover demand post-Covid|Limited development supports high occupancy rate|Cash flows less sensitive to downturn relative to nearby NYC and New Jersey markets|Consistent net decline in office-using jobs as the market loses large employers to NYC|Urban setting more appealing post-Covid; superior labor pool in NYC|High nominal yields are unsupported by long-term growth opportunities leading to poor risk-adjusted returns
9|186|Office|Los Angeles|Los Angeles: The LA apartment market is comprised of many cities across a vast geographic area and contains some of the highest barrier-to-entry submarkets in the nation (e.g., Santa Monica, Malibu Hills). Demand for housing in LA continues to exceed available supply, putting pressure on renters in a high-barrier, landlord-favored market. In 2H’19, AB 1482 was enacted by Governor Newsom implementing statewide rent control for renewal offers on apartments older than 15 years. The law will be in effect from January ’20 until January ‘30. Additionally, Prop 21, a measure to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, will appear on the November ’20 ballot (a similar ballot measure failed in ’18), reigniting concern amongst landlords that local governments may be able to enact more restrictive forms of rent control. Prospective investors should look west of the I-405 freeway, known as the Westside, for the strongest long-term rent growth potential as these highly desirable and supply-constrained submarkets are supported by healthy demographics and solid high-paying job growth. Los Angeles is one of the most highly regulated markets in the U.S., as geographical barriers, NIMBYism, and elevated construction costs keep supply in check. Tight supply dynamics and robust demand will continue to contribute to strong long-term NOI growth for the market.|Attractive destination for employers and residents because of the dynamic live / work / play environment|Gentrification improving in the CBD, traditionally home to financial services and law firms|Beverly Hills and Century City submarkets offer some of the strongest LT rent growth potential nationwide|Above-average population density levels may delay the return to office|Significant concentration of tech giants, which have been at the forefront of the potential WFH shift |High cost of living / doing business both locally and statewide
9|187|Office|Louisville|Louisville: With a regional focus and high employment concentration in manufacturing and other traditionally low-growth industries, Louisville’s economic prospects remain muted as compared with its Midwest peers. Some job growth has occurred in the metro, but mainly in the low-wage manufacturing and wholesale sectors; employment growth in the higher-paying TAMI and FIRE industries has been virtually nonexistent. A lack of demand stemming from minimal job growth is exacerbated by the metro’s relatively less desirable lifestyle, evident by minimal millennial population inflow. Demand headwinds and lack of  supply barriers limit a landlord’s ability to push rent. Additionally, the market’s low cost of living  drives homeownership relative to other metros, further hindering long-term rent growth. Like much of the Midwest, high going-in yields appear attractive, but there is little upside as the metro’s underwhelming outlook over the intermediate and long term limit return expectations.|Several large fast food / health care companies may help to generate office-using jobs|Population and GDP growth is expected to outpace most Midwest cities|Mild development pipeline and high going-in yields may be attractive to some investors|Poor fiscal health and inability to meaningfully diversify outside of the manufacturing industry|Without the necessary acceleration towards high-growth sectors, like TAMI, office fundamentals likely to remain dismal|Weak university system and low education levels makes it difficult to attract new employers to the metro
9|188|Office|Memphis|Memphis: The Memphis economy continues to miss out on the wave of growth in the technology and professional services industries that has propelled other southern metros. Concentrated in the trade and manufacturing sectors, Memphis’s undiversified and stagnant economy establishes a low ceiling on rent growth as high-paying jobs are few and far between. One of the few strengths of the markets lies in its low cash flow volatility, bolstered in part by a handful of Fortune 500 HQs. As the economy continues to find its footing amidst an on-going recession, Memphis’s low tech exposure contributes to a near-term M-RevPAF growth prospect that is expected to slightly outperform our top market average. TAMI and FIRE employment bases in Memphis are small and growing at a meager pace. Demographics in the ‘Home of Blues’ also bode poorly, as population growth significantly lags that of other southern metros and low-to-middle income households comprise a larger share of the market than the national average. Poor market fundamentals and struggling demographics, compounded by an active supply pipeline, present headwinds that render Memphis’ return profile among the least attractive in the country.|Access to relatively cheap labor makes metro better candidate for relocations|Favorable incentives offered to outside businesses to operate in Memphis (e.g., tax, training, utility, and financing)|Low cash flow volatility offers stable returns during downturns|High vacancy rates driven by lack of demand and employment growth|Human Capital is less competitive than most top markets due to less educated population|Population growth forecast remains flat
9|189|Office|Miami|Miami: Miami’s business-friendly environment and cultural amenities support healthy demographics and long-term apartment fundamentals. Since '13, Miami has seen domestic out-migration, largely to other Florida metros, as some residents are priced out of the growing city; however, international immigrants and high-earners seeking low taxes have driven steady per-capita income growth (average income of a person moving to Miami has exceeded those leaving). Miami’s low-tax environment has also attracted a growing tech / finance presence and solid job growth in the metro. Elevated supply, largely in the Downtown, Opa-Locka, and Miami Beach submarkets, remains a concern but is outweighed by strong demand growth, resulting in a healthy near-term M-RevPAF growth forecast. In the Downtown submarket, the trendy Wynwood and the Design District neighborhoods are seeing notable supply in response to their popularity with millennials, while Little Haiti has been pegged as the next neighborhood to gentrify. Investors should also take note of Miami Worldcenter, a mixed-use project that will add ~1.9k new apartment units to the Downtown submarket by '21. Brickell remains a favorite submarket for its central location and strong demographics while Coral Gables stands out for its minimal supply pipeline. As a desirable metro with favorable demographics, Miami’s long-term rent growth potential for apartments is among the best of our top markets. 	|New Brightline commuter rail announced in ’20 to decrease traffic and congestion|Strong university presence throughout South Florida supports continued corporate relocation|International business center and door to Latin America|Concentration in low-paying industries limits income growth|Losing residents to lower-cost Florida metros|Supply growth at its highest level since '09, bringing >2M SF (~4% of inventory) to the metro over the next 2 years
9|191|Office|Minneapolis|Minneapolis: Despite a number of large, stable employers, a full construction pipeline is weighing on Minneapolis’ intermediate rent growth outlook. Long-term advantages for the market include an outsized presence of S&P 500 companies and an educated labor force from nearby universities. However, local health care employment growth decelerated meaningfully throughout ’19 and bears watching moving forward. Local housing policy changes are further complicating the picture for apartment investors; Minneapolis’ “2040 Comprehensive Plan” upzones the majority of the city and effectively decreases supply barriers for much of the market. Furthermore, inclusionary zoning efforts are currently underway, intending to mandate that a portion of newly developed units be set aside as affordable housing. Currently, an interim plan is in place with the intention of more robust legislation being enacted. Elevated new supply and tepid employment growth over the coming years result in below-average market rent growth and weak long-term growth estimates.|Home to the most corporate HQ’s per capita in the U.S.; helps lay the foundation for office fundamentals|Highly skilled workforce makes it an attractive destination for employers, lower unemployment relative to top markets|Diverse workforce mix and above-average GDP growth forecasts may help to stabilize the office market|Significant occupancy struggles hinders rent growth potential in most submarkets in the metro|Robust decline in the health care sector in recent years has been a drag on the region’s employment growth|High corporate tax rate may prevent near-term corporate relocations as Covid-19 already affected profitability
9|192|Office|Nashville|Nashville: Nashville’s educated workforce, relative affordability, and significant population growth have attracted large companies to the metro. Alliance Bernstein is relocating its global headquarters, which will bring ~1,050 jobs to Nashville, and Amazon plans to bring another ~5,000 jobs to its new downtown operations hub, both of whom began hiring in '19 and will continue to hire through '24. The meaningful job growth over the past couple years has been a positive tailwind for apartment fundamentals. As rents climbed over the past several years during this local economic boom, regulators have altered zoning laws that allow for more developments in the urban core, leading to increased supply. The meaningful new supply is driving below-average M-RevPAF growth expectations despite significant in-migration and job growth. Nashville also benefits from a leading health care industry; 17 publicly traded health care companies are headquartered in the city, which supports high-paying jobs and economic stability. One caution facing apartment demand is the high homeownership rate outside of the Downtown and Airport submarkets.  While a healthy supply pipeline and high homeownership rate pose some threats to apartment fundamentals, the stable health care industry and significant population growth provides investors with solid long-term growth potential.|Educated workforce combined with strong local universities drives quality talent|Low-tax / business-friendly environment|Increasing white-collar jobs bolster office-using population|Higher corporate tax rate is a factor for businesses relocating from Gateway markets|Aging transportation infrastructure hinders growth in suburban markets|Previous office-using sectors (i.e., FIRE & TAMI) may decrease demand for space in the wake of WFH revelations 
9|195|Office|New York|New York: As the epicenter of the U.S. pandemic, New York faced steep job losses and deteriorating apartment fundamentals in the first half of ‘20. Finance remains the backbone of New York’s economy, and though not immune from layoffs, fared better than most industries in 1H’20. Growing tech interest in the city of late is a bright spot for apartment demand, with Facebook, Google, and Amazon all announcing large-scale expansions in ’19 (>20k jobs collectively). However, it remains to be seen if tech companies will modify pre-COVID plans following the acceleration in working from home. NYC would be a relative loser to lower-cost metros in a world where remote working becomes widely adopted. New York’s budget deficits worsened following the pandemic, and now require an estimated  ~600 bps increase to the median renter’s tax burden to cover the shortfall, which could accelerate recent outmigration. Asking rents fell precipitously in 1H’20 (~-10% YoY) and leasing activity was accompanied by a notable rise in concessions (~50% of new leases included concessions as of June ‘20). Just as investors began to wrap their heads around the expansive rent control laws passed in June ’19 by the state, transaction markets froze in 2Q’20 due to uncertainty surrounding asset prices, which have likely fallen double-digits.. A favorable supply outlook remains a silver lining for NYC, but apartment investors face significant headwinds in the coming years and a less-favorable long-term outlook in a post-COVID world. |Large and diverse employment base – business capital of the U.S.|Market attracts domestic and foreign investment|Positive recent growth from TAMI employers (e.g., Amazon); an encouraging signal of tenant appetite for Class A space|New influx of supply on Far West Side cannibalizing tenants from increasingly obsolescent stock found in Midtown|High cost of living and unfriendly business environment driving residents and employers away from the market|WFH trends weigh on future leasing activity as tenants should require less space going forward
9|196|Office|Norfolk / Hampton Roads|Norfolk/Hampton Roads: The Norfolk / Hampton Roads market has experienced instability in recent years as the region’s reliance upon shipbuilding and government sector employment has taken a sizeable hit due to fiscal budget volatility and waning demand for shipbuilding. It is still unclear whether trade conflict with China will escalate and adversely affect market fundamentals. Steady growth in professional and business services has helped offset declines in government employment. Norfolk has the unique benefit of being a military town, as many military service members provide a foundation for the renter population. Local politicians have noted the need for increased retention of young adults to boost the regional economy and have spearheaded several initiatives to increase its cultural appeal. The efforts haven’t resulted in any major relocations, but the development of Ferguson’s new 8-story corporate HQ in Newport News, which was heavily subsidized by the city, provides anecdotal evidence that the government is ready and willing to sponsor local businesses. Retention of young adults will be critical to both the Norfolk / Hampton Roads economy as well as for renter demand. |Limited development activity|Demand increasing in the CBD|Local gov't willing to subsidize local businesses |Competition from nearby metros|Poor demographics|Inability to attract large corporate headquarters
9|197|Office|New Jersey (Northern)|New Jersey (Northern): Outsized job losses and subpar population growth pressure apartment fundamentals in Northern New Jersey. The metro serves as a cheaper alternative to Manhattan, especially in the urban Hudson County, but spillover demand from NYC has yet to translate into strong M-RevPAF growth. Several submarkets, including Hoboken and Jersey City, may begin to benefit from proximity to high-paying job growth across the river in Hudson Yards. The rise in work from home may accelerate this phenomenon, but it remains to be seen whether renters would rather flee NYC’s urban core for the cheaper NJ region, or instead opt to leave the NY-NJ area altogether given New Jersey’s dire fiscal health profile (~700bp tax increase required to cover the state’s unfunded liabilities). Future job forecasts remain underwhelming, but M-RevPAF growth should prove less sensitive to the economy in the near term. The expiration of the “Grow NJ” tax incentive program in ’19 dealt another blow to the region as the state has yet to find a replacement despite its moderate success in attracting relocations to the northern part of the state. Without tax incentives, Northern New Jersey will likely continue to shed jobs to more affordable metros, as companies are enticed by lower costs of business and faster-growing labor pools. Rent growth has lagged the top markets following elevated deliveries in ’17 and ’18, but the current supply pipeline should allow fundamentals to play catch-up in the intermediate term, resulting in a modest return profile.|Life science clustering and overall industry growth should help demand|Favorable demographic profile (e.g., dense population, educated workforce, and strong university system)|“NJ Economic Recovery Act 2020” should be a boon for business and demand through 7-year tenure|Market asset value growth has trailed top market average given weak fundamentals the last decade|State fiscal health deteriorating; more taxes likely to resolve budget and pensions deficits|Elevated vacancies  accelerated by the pandemic shift pricing power to tenants limiting rent growth
9|198|Office|Oakland-East Bay|Oakland-East Bay: While the East Bay has often been overlooked by institutional capital in past cycles, exceptionally low cap rates and softening fundamentals in neighboring Bay Area markets could shift additional interest to the relatively higher going-in yields in Oakland. Though still in the early innings, if the current work from home trend continues to accelerate, Oakland could be a relative winner as renters seek cheaper alternatives to San Francisco and Silicon Valley. Near-term growth forecasts reflect slightly stronger performance relative to its Bay Area peers as a result of these developing trends. Employer interest in Oakland has grown in recent years with multiple companies (e.g., Facebook and Microsoft) expressing interest in the area, a trend that should contribute to healthy population growth. In late ’19,  Facebook announced plans to increase their footprint in the market to upwards of ~1.3M SF of office space, which appears to be moving forward as planned. Increasingly strict California regulations and NIMBYism throughout the market keep the development pipeline lower than average. The Downtown submarket, however, should continue to see elevated deliveries in the near and intermediate term as a result of its proximity to public transit and its walkability, making it an appealing location for young renters and employees commuting into San Francisco. Though going-in yields remain low, healthy intermediate- and long-term NOI growth contribute to returns that rank among the top of the pack.  |Supply pipeline expected to remain under control and lag SF|Lower cost alternative for both employers and residents in Bay Area|Income growth forecast remains above-average with tech companies continuing to increase their presence in the market|Prop 15 (tax on commercial properties) failed in the November '20 election - likely to appear in subsequent elections|Traffic congestion remains a concern as BART expansion and other infrastructure improvements remain years away |	Below-average demographics in the Richmond and Airport submarkets
9|201|Office|Orange County|Orange County: Healthy income growth and limited development have been the key drivers of Orange County’s improving apartment fundamentals in recent years. Job growth in Orange County has been mediocre of late, but the region enjoys a diversified workforce led by notable companies like Walt Disney, Boeing, and The Irvine Company. Because of the market’s housing costs, which are amongst the highest in the nation, residents are often forced to rent, creating a tailwind for apartment demand. California recently enacted a series of bills intended to address the state’s affordability issues, which may make it incrementally easier to develop apartments; however, multifamily permitting activity growth has consistently slowed over the last 3 years. In 2H’19, AB 1482 was enacted by Governor Newsom implementing statewide rent control for renewal offers on apartments that are older than 15 years. The law will be in effect beginning in January ’20 until January ‘30. Additionally, Prop 21, a measure to amend the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, will appear on the November ’20 ballot (a similar ballot measure failed in ’18), reigniting fear amongst landlords that local governments may be able to enact more restrictive forms of rent control. Investors should also be cognizant of The Irvine Company, which controls much of the region’s inventory and often influences market rents.|Diverse tenant base - little concentration risk|Geographic and regulatory supply barriers|Strong demographics in Newport Center and South County submarkets |Increased vacancy levels due to new high-priced inventory coming online in the Airport submarket|Few tax / business incentives for relocating companies |Elevated traffic congestion and long commute times 
9|202|Office|Orlando|Orlando: Orlando is the most visited destination in the country with >70M annual visitors. With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, international travel has halted, damaging Orlando’s tourism-based economy and driving the unemployment rate to be among the worst of top markets in the early innings of the downturn. In recent years, Florida's business-friendly environment and the growth of the University of Central Florida have brought higher-wage jobs, such as professional services and health care, to the market, providing some insulation from Covid-19 fallout. Supply growth in Orlando is among the highest of top markets with the Southwest, South Central, and Maitland / Winter Park submarkets seeing the brunt of oncoming supply. Notable developments include downtown’s Creative Village, where UCF and Valencia’s shared campus opened in the summer of '19, bringing >7k students to downtown with long-term plans for ~15k students and >1.5k apartment units in the development. Despite supply growth concerns, investors should look to Maitland / Winter Park and South Central, particularly Thornton Park, for some of the market’s highest rents. Ultimately, investors should expect challenged near-term fundamentals as Orlando faces a tough recovery and struggles to absorb an elevated supply pipeline. In the long term, exceptional job and population growth create a healthy outlook for Orlando’s rent growth potential, though cap rates have compressed meaningfully in the market pre-Covid-19, tempering long-term return potential. |Business-friendly environment (no state income tax, low corporate taxes)|City willing to provide incentive packages for corporate relocation|Home to UCF, America’s largest university with over 65k students and a burgeoning medical school|Less affluent and educated population than top market average|Minimal Fortune 500 presence and not a top institutional office market|Job growth historically centered in non-office using sectors (e.g., hospitality, retail, etc.)
9|203|Office|Palm Beach|Palm Beach: With population growth forecasts that best its South Florida peers and many top markets, Palm Beach is gradually evolving from a sleepy retirement town to an up-and-coming metro. Attracted to the market’s amenities, affordability, and low taxes, financial and business services companies have relocated to the metro while the hospitality and health care industries have also seen consistent growth. Virgin Trains USA now connects Palm Beach to Miami and will connect Palm Beach to Orlando in coming years. Supply growth, centered in the West Palm Beach, Lake Worth, and Boca Raton submarkets remains elevated, but has moderated after a spike in ‘17. Investors should look to the Boca Raton East submarket, which stands out for having the most educated population and the highest rents in the metro. Strong growth forecasts and a desirable lifestyle bode well for Palm Beach, ranking it above most top markets in terms of long-term rent growth potential and near-term M-RevPAF growth expectations. 	|Potential to continue to benefit from NYC corporate relocation; may be a relative WFH winner|Business-friendly environment; no state income tax|Most educated of Florida markets|Outsized speculative office development with office completions reaching their highest level since '09|Lagging income growth|Working age individuals account for only ~60% of the total population, less than any other top market
9|204|Office|Philadelphia|Philadelphia: Philadelphia’s affordability versus other major East Coast markets (e.g., New York, D.C.) is a draw for some renters, but underwhelming job growth expectations sets the stage for below-average apartment fundamentals. The region’s large education and health care presence (e.g., University of Pennsylvania, Jefferson Healthcare system) provides stable employment, and a rapidly-growing life sciences industry has been a bright spot in Philly’s otherwise tepid economy, attracting strong venture capital inflows to the city (~$2.5B in ’19). The influx of tech funding paired with an abundance of local research facilities is expected to drive above-average income growth. The city’s punitive tax structure and unfriendly business environment largely limits major corporate relocations to the metro, and most cities that do set up shop choose to do so in the suburbs where taxes are less onerous. As such, there is a disconnect between where typical apartment renters live (CBD) and where the job growth is concentrated (suburbs). Investments in the city center and a drastically reduced crime rate have improved the city’s ability in retaining young talent (25-34 age cohort population growth has outpaced the overall average), but total population trends still prove worrisome. Philly’s capital flows are better than the city’s historic record, driven by smaller investors expanding outside of the surrounding metros in search of higher going-in yields.|Strong university system provides access to skilled labor|Rapid life sciences growth driving demand; Philadelphia-area life science firms secured >$500M of VC investment in ‘20|Job recovery outpaced the top market average in ‘20|Lower-quality office building rents and values expected to be disproportionately impacted in ‘21|Stagnant population growth and weak job growth expectations hinder demand profile|Below-average Desirability Index may deter new companies from relocating to Philadelphia
9|205|Office|Phoenix|Phoenix: Phoenix apartment fundamentals are bolstered by top-ranked job and population growth expectations. As a low-cost alternative to major California markets, Phoenix continues to draw residents from its neighbors to the west. Infosys, an IT services company, will move into the newly-delivered Novus Innovation Corridor in the North Tempe submarket once offices are able to reopen and intend to bring ~1k jobs to Phoenix by ’23. As additional companies are attracted to Tempe, apartment demand in the North and South Tempe submarkets should increase due to the walkable, urban amenities, and access to various transit alternatives. The Roosevelt Row (RoRo) neighborhood in the Downtown submarket is an up-and-coming neighborhood that is growing in popularity. Demand in Phoenix is expected to continue outpacing the high levels of supply for now, leading to relatively high levels of near-term M-RevPAF growth. Over longer periods of time, supply will likely catch up with demand, resulting in average long-term growth prospects. |Above-average cap rates and strong long-term growth prospects drive attractive return expectations |Corporate tax rates below 5% increases the market’s desirability for employers|Access to an international airport makes for convenient business travel|Human capital is weakened by low levels of educational attainment throughout a majority of the metro|Secular headwinds facing the office sector (i.e., WFH) coupled with a large supply pipeline limit rent growth potential|Limited Fortune 500 presence in the market
9|206|Office|Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh: Investors should exhibit cautious optimism when considering the “Steel City’s” apartment sector. While the Pittsburgh economy lags nearby East Coast metros due to its dependence on low-growth industries, a strong university system supports the nascent tech industry that is slowly gaining traction in the metro. Though employers like Apple, Facebook, and Google recruit from these universities that specialize in artificial intelligence, life sciences, and robotics projects, overall employment growth in other sectors remains poor and Pittsburgh’s tech scene is still growing off a low base. Much of the development and transactions in the apartment sector occur in the CBD and Oakland / East End submarkets. Here, investors find the highest rent growth potential while still yielding attractive going-in cap rates. These submarkets are changing from aging industrial buildings to new office and apartment developments. The $273M “3 Crossings” master plan is set to build 2 apartment buildings with ~300 units by ‘21, among other developments. Despite these emerging positive trends, caution should be exhibited as the metro battles high millennial out-migration rates as graduates from the metro’s elite university systems look toward more desirable markets for employment. Additionally, rent growth is limited by the metro’s lack of supply constraints and inexpensive home prices, which drive high homeownership rates. Pittsburgh displays one of the highest economic cap rates in the nation, but worrying long-term growth prospects deserve a watchful eye.|Emerging tech and life science industries|Low cost of living provides a benefit of relocating to Pittsburgh|Below-average supply growth pipeline |Low Desirability Index compared to other tech hubs|Economy anchored by mining and manufacturing industries|Weak demand in suburban submarkets
9|207|Office|Portland|Portland: Portland’s apartment fundamentals are driven by solid job and population growth among young adults looking for relative affordability and a high quality of life. The significant in-migration has resulted in robust rent growth over the last few years; however, developers have quickly caught on. Completions in ’19 reached an all-time high and while fewer new starts are now expected because of Covid-19, projects still in the pipeline will likely outpace demand in the coming years. Portland’s decision to enact statewide rent control has garnered national attention, and while the long-term impact of the new law remains unknown, it is expected to have a minimal effect on short-term apartment fundamentals since the 7+% inflation rent cap is far above rent growth projections. The concern lies within whether it will lead to tighter limits down the road that would negatively impact investors' ability to increase rents, hurting overall returns. A recently-passed measure that requires cities with >25,000 people to allow duplexes, triplexes, and quadplexes in areas zoned for single-family suggest already-low barriers to supply will ease further.	|Portland has increasingly become recognized for its growing startup scene|Portland International Airport is recognized as one of the best airports in the U.S, a positive business growth|A diverse economy and ability to attract a young / skilled population base bodes well for long-term growth|One of the highest corporate income tax rates relative to the top markets; and imposes a separate gross receipts tax|The CBD submarket is seeing some demand fall-off as companies relocate to the Westside submarkets|Competes with larger West Coast markets
9|209|Office|Raleigh-Durham|Raleigh-Durham: Raleigh’s demographic profile has improved meaningfully after benefiting from exceptional employment growth over the last cycle and experiencing an influx of younger age cohorts. The recent demographic trends are expected to continue with near-term employment growth forecasted to be amongst the strongest of our top markets. Proximity to top universities, affordable living costs, and desirable submarkets are some of the key factors behind Raleigh’s strong population growth and domestic in-migration trends. As a result of strengthening demographics, M-RevPAF growth forecasts are expected to outperform most of our top markets. Raleigh’s booming apartment demand, however, has not been overlooked by local developers, and with low barriers to development, supply growth should continue to restrain rent growth over the next few years. One notable project contributing to the elevated supply pipeline in ’20 and ’21 includes Midtown Exchange, a $1B mixed-use project that will include ~1,300 new apartment units. Strong long-term growth forecasts offset low going-in yields following cap rate compression in recent years, resulting in solid return expectations. |Office-using job growth is poised to outpace the Sun Belt average through significant TAMI / life sciences tilt|Corporate tax environment and strong Human Capital score will benefit corporate in-migration|High quality office / life sciences space in RTP has given tenants flexibility and attracts external demand|Large development pipeline in the RTP and Six Forks submarket|WFH utilization a threat for office demand within the market given strong tech presence|Recent spikes in vacancy rates outside of CBD / RTP, notably in Northeast Wake County signal excess supply
9|210|Office|Richmond|Richmond: A relatively affordable lifestyle and decent Fortune 500 presence drive apartment demand in Richmond, including headquarters for notable companies such as Altria and Carmax. The local economy relies heavily on business services and government jobs. Despite the region’s favorable cost of business, job growth has lagged behind the top market average consistently since mid-’16 (though the trend  somewhat reversed in 1H’20). The departure of Building Commissioner Douglas Murrow in ’18, whose stringent policies and slow-moving approval procedures were a source of headaches for local developers, has already increased the ease of real estate construction and led to a record-high development pipeline. Approval of ~$3M in tax breaks for Lynx Venture’s proposed 165-unit building in the Downtown / The Fan submarket is emblematic of the city’s new pro-development policies. Revitalization efforts in the Scott’s Addition neighborhood and the Downtown / The Fan submarkets has attracted an influx of millennials. An attractive going-in yield slightly offset by below-average long-term NOI growth expectations results in a solid return profile for apartment investors.|Strong Fiscal Health should prevent near-term tax increases|Strong university system provides access to an educated labor pool|Limited development pipeline contributes to one of the highest occupancy levels of all top markets|Job growth concentrated in low-paying administrative roles|Lack of geographic or regulatory supply barriers |Low population density drags on overall demand profile
9|212|Office|Sacramento|Sacramento: Fundamentals in Sacramento appear to be holding up nicely, with near-term M-RevPAF growth forecasted to outpace most top markets. As the Golden State capital, Sacramento benefits from strong and resilient employment in the public sector which has contributed to steady income growth over the last several years. The University submarket is likely to outperform others in Sacramento over the long term due to a denser population base and large presence of a younger renting cohort. As NIMBYism remains a significant impediment and lower rents make developments difficult to pencil, the supply pipeline is forecasted to remain relatively low. Though Sacramento struggles to compete with San Francisco and Silicon Valley for prominent tech interest, accelerating work from home trends could drive renter demand as employees are able to live further from their jobs and enjoy cheaper rents and  larger spaces. This trend has yet to fully play out and has room to run, thus long-term rent expectations in the market remain in line with the top markets. With high going-in yields relative to other California markets and healthy growth expectations, Sacramento boasts among the highest expected returns across the top markets. |Recent in-migration from the Bay Area increases the talent pool in the metro|New supply remains relatively constrained, aiding rent growth potential|High concentration of suburban inventory; could potentially benefit from companies looking to leave the urban core|The state of CA leases >9M SF in the metro; potential risk if the state cuts costs by reducing office space|TAMI job growth has failed to catch momentum as the market must compete with the Bay Area to attract new companies|Low supply barriers and below-average desirability limit long-term growth potential
9|213|Office|Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City: Salt Lake City’s economy continues to diversify as companies from various sectors are drawn to the metro’s business-friendly environment and deep talent pool. A large portion of the market’s strong population growth is concentrated among younger age groups who are attracted to the lifestyle and job market, fueling demand for apartments in the CBD submarket due to the close proximity to many offices and the relatively urban, walkable location. Developers have responded to this demand with the construction of notable developments including The Block 67 project and The Exchange, which will add a combined ~1k units by ‘21. Many of these luxury apartments are highly amenitized developments targeting millennials and new residents, but ~80 apartments in The Exchange will be left for affordable housing. Developers will be able to keep the vast majority of units at market rates, though, as the Utah government did not pass a bill to give cities the choice to impose rent control in 1Q’20. The flood of supply in the market has dampened what would have been otherwise robust fundamentals the last three years, but favorable demand should be more than enough to absorb units that deliver over the next few years. Long-term NOI growth is aided by solid fiscal health and the metro’s relative desirability, and a high initial yield combined with a favorable growth outlook make for attractive potential long-term returns. |Economy has a diverse mix of sectors, with drivers from tech and finance|Growing millennial population attracted to low cost of living|Light rail system allows for fluid movement from downtown to suburbs|Low barriers to supply draws new construction; 330k SF to be delivered in heart of CBD in ‘22|Some industries allowing WFH; residents are expressing increased productivity out of office|Few major corporate headquarters
9|214|Office|San Antonio|San Antonio: Despite recent positive demand trends, the San Antonio apartment sector continues to face fundamental pressure stemming from the region’s housing affordability and lack of supply barriers. The metro has been a beneficiary of the fracking boom which has increased job and population growth, and it has also seen an increase in higher paying health care jobs; significant investment has been made to improve / expand health care facilities. Four large military bases provide stability and promote economic activity. Current rent and occupancy remain depressed from a large wave of new deliveries that hit the market in ’16 and ’17 during the energy recession, but stable demand supported by its exposure to the military has caused near-term M-RevPAF growth forecasts to be among the best of the top markets. Supply pipelines remain large in the near-term, while longer term, low barriers to entry, low levels of human capital, and large pockets of crime / poverty contribute to San Antonio’s mediocre long-term NOI growth prospects. The northern submarkets are better positioned than their southern counterparts, with the Northeast submarket standing out as a cut above the rest given its superior demographics. In aggregate, San Antonio screens middle-of-the-pack as compared with the rest of the top apartment markets regarding return expectations.|Affordable and low tax burden relative to other major markets|Employment has rebounded sharply, and growth is expected to outpace the national average|Commute times within and around the CBD are significantly lower than top 50 market average|Less competitive talent pool due to low education attainment|Lack of office-using jobs relative to other markets (healthcare and biosciences industry concentration)|Robust development pipeline with minimal space preleased  
9|215|Office|Inland Empire|Inland Empire: With rental rates and home prices in Los Angeles and Orange County among the highest in the nation, many have turned to the neighboring Inland Empire as a cheaper housing alternative which has resulted in strengthening apartment fundamentals for the metro. The region’s position as a prominent west coast logistics hub has created thousands of new jobs—resulting in above-average population growth—and continues to drive decent housing demand. Chino and Corona, the closest submarkets to LA and OC, have seen the strongest renter demand due to above-average income levels and rising home prices. Given a severe housing shortage and overall lack of affordability, in 2H’19 AB 1482 was enacted by Governor Newsom implementing statewide rent control for renewal offers on apartments that are older than 15 years. The law will be in effect from January ’20 through January ‘30. Additionally, Prop 21, a measure to amend the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, will appear on the November ’20 ballot (a similar ballot measure failed in ’18), reigniting fear amongst landlords that local governments may be able to enact more restrictive forms of rent control. On the supply front, development has been dormant for much of this cycle, with most new deliveries being garden-style multifamily units. Single-family affordability and low-wage job growth relative to other Southern California metros will be among the largest long-term headwinds for apartment owners versus most West Coast markets.|Strong rent growth in Moreno / Perris / Hemet submarket relative to market as a whole|Key distribution hub; may benefit office demand |Healthy levels of population growth|Competes with CA gateway markets for talent|Key office-using sectors, like professional services, have struggled to establish meaningful footprints in the metro |Limited demand curbs landlord pricing power 
9|216|Office|San Diego|San Diego: San Diego is consistently recognized as one of the most desirable places to live in the U.S. because of its pleasant climate, healthy demographics, and 70 miles of picturesque coastline. Fundamentals are supported by the strong university network that retains ~50% of students as full-time residents post-graduation, and home prices that remain unaffordable for recent graduates and most young families. The market is home to an array of headquarters including Sempra Energy and Qualcomm, along with a variety of employers that are drawn to San Diego’s talented workforce. New, highly amenitized supply growth is concentrated in the Downtown submarket, which has the lowest homeownership rate in San Diego at ~20%. San Diego has high supply constraints due to natural and legislative barriers. In Downtown San Diego, developers must comply with a 500-ft cap on buildings because of its close proximity to the airport. In 2H’19, AB 1482 was enacted by Governor Newsom implementing statewide rent control for renewal offers on apartments that are older than 15 years. The law will be in effect beginning January ’20 until January ‘30. Additionally, Prop 21, a measure to amend the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act will appear on the November ’20 ballot (a similar ballot measure failed in ’18), reigniting fear among landlords that local governments may be able to enact more restrictive forms of rent control. |A diverse workforce provides economic stability for the market|STEM-focused universities support life science job demand|Desirable lifestyle allows the market to attract and retain talent|Recent developments, such as the redevelopment of Horton Plaza, threaten to increase supply in the CBD|Slowing growth of working age population forecasted through ‘25|The market struggles to capture increases in technology jobs as it is in competition with other California markets
9|217|Office|San Francisco|San Francisco: As a top tech hub with exceptionally high income levels, stable employment forecasts and one of the most educated population bases in the country, San Francisco remains among the most expensive places to rent. San Francisco continues to be one of the most difficult cities to build in, with NIMBYism, as well as geographic and regulatory barriers to development, impeding new supply. Political risk remains significant in the market as California, especially as leaders in Los Angeles and San Francisco, continue to tilt more populist and implement new legislation accordingly. Though Prop 10 (repeal of Costa-Hawkins Act, which limits the scope of rent control) lost in ‘18, the passage of AB 1482 in the state of California (limits annual rent increases to 5%),  took effect in early ’20. Similar campaigns are likely to pop up over the next several years with the most notable one being another potential repeal of Costa-Hawkins revisiting the ballot in November ‘20. Despite developing legislative headwinds, San Francisco’s long-term rent growth is likely to outperform most top markets largely as a result of the regulatory constraints and strong human capital. Further, homeownership in the Bay Area remains out of reach for many, especially in San Francisco, where the median home price reaches >$1M. It is worth noting that as work from home trends accelerate and companies (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) formulate plans for at least a portion of employees to permanently work remote, San Francisco’s high exposure to the tech industry may become a growing concern. Though going-in yields are low, elevated long-term NOI growth projections boost San Francisco toward the top of our return expectations across the  top markets. |High barriers to new supply via in-place regulations (e.g., Proposition M)|Status as a knowledge hub should help to retain companies and attract top talent|Desirable city life will continue to attract young professionals|Elevated sublease space poses a risk to the recovery of San Francisco's office market|Above-average density levels could delay return to offices|Tech industry has been at the forefront of potential WFH shift 
9|218|Office|San Jose|San Jose: Big tech firms and their educated and well-compensated workforce drove much of the success in the South Bay market over the last cycle. In late ‘19, Facebook and Google announced plans to expand their presences by a combined ~8M SF in San Jose, creating space for an additional ~35k employees in the market. With multiple companies, including Facebook, expressing plans to shift a portion of employees to remote work solutions permanently, it remains unclear what portion of these jobs will be in the office full time as the secular shift to working from home continues to play out. In an attempt to improve the Bay Area housing crisis, Facebook, Google, and Apple have each pledged $1B to build additional housing and keep further home price appreciation at bay. Additional infrastructure projects include the ~$5.5B Silicon Valley BART expansion which will connect Oakland to San Jose and allow the workforce to travel between the metros more easily. Though affordable housing initiatives have become seemingly ubiquitous across California, favorable regulatory barriers remain in place, limiting future market rate supply growth. . While San Jose had been a relative winner of migration trends throughout much of the last cycle, near-term population growth forecasts appear to be in line with our top market average stemming from uncertainty related to the work from home shift. Though going-in yields remain low, and near-term growth prospects are stunted, strong long-term growth forecasts contribute to healthy return expectations.|Top local universities continue to drive the knowledge hub|Strong employment forecast relative to the top market average|Many young professionals likely to remain in the market for career growth opportunities|Above-average density levels could delay return to offices|Evolving office practices could change how tech companies use space in the future|Slowing near-term population growth 
9|219|Office|Seattle|Seattle: The prominence of giant tech firms, including Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, continue to drive high-paying job growth to the region. Apartment fundamentals have greatly benefited from the rapid expansion of these tech companies as they compete for top talent in the metro. Just within the past year, Apple, Amazon, and Expedia have added a combined ~6,000 jobs to Seattle, primarily concentrated in the South Lake Union and Bellevue submarkets. Institutional capital interest in the region has ramped— and with it came a wave of new development. The South Lake Union, Bellevue, and Central submarkets, Seattle’s most expensive areas, are seeing the highest new supply, likely causing rent growth to slow as developments are completed. In addition, legislation was passed in ‘19 that will lower barriers to supply in several submarkets. Microsoft announced plans to invest $500M to provide affordable housing in the Kirkland, Bellevue, and Federal Way submarkets. Individuals looking for rent relief from Seattle’s most expensive areas are fueling new demand and boosting fundamentals in the submarkets of Everett, Kent, and Federal Way. Despite weakening demand from the impacts of the pandemic, Seattle’s long-term growth and return expectations are among the best relative to other coastal markets.  |Seattle’s highly educated talent pool and population growth continues to attract top employers|Other Puget Sound-area cities will likely benefit from the city-imposed payroll tax, notably Bellevue|The 5G Open Innovation Lab is attracting more global talent and investment to the region|New payroll tax, based on income level, poses major threats to office space in Seattle proper if companies relocate|A heavy supply pipeline will likely put pressure on ability to push market rents|High volatility from economic dependence of a few large firms, notably Amazon, Microsoft, and Google
9|220|Office|St. Louis|St. Louis: Fundamentals in St. Louis remain uninspiring as the market’s high exposure to low-growth sectors, such as manufacturing and trade, have rendered the local economy a laggard in terms of GDP and employment growth relative to other Midwest markets. While supply barriers remain low with few regulatory or geographic constraints, low growth and minimal demand have kept new development at bay. Given the market’s poor performance amidst a tepid supply pipeline, this trend is worrisome for local owners. Employment growth, which had been sluggish throughout most of the last cycle, will likely prove even more troublesome as employment trends are expected to slow amid the ongoing recession. A bright spot for the region has been Boeing and GM’s continued investment in the market; Boeing’s regional workforce has expanded by 2k jobs over the last couple years and GM recently invested $1.5B into their Wentzville truck factory. It remains to be seen how Boeing’s ongoing 737 troubles, further exacerbated by the current pandemic which has significantly reduced travel demand, will impact local hiring. Further headwinds for the St. Louis apartment market include an aging and stagnant population base as well as very affordable single-family homes. Relatively high going-in yields offset weak intermediate and long-term growth forecasts which results in a return profile that is expected to be in line with our top market average.|Strong local talent coming from schools like Washington University|Increasing economic output from FIRE and business service sectors|Life sciences sector emerging; $524M investment from National Institutes of Health went to Wash U and local startups|Employment growth expected to stall in the near term and remain low over the next 5 years|Fundamentals in Clayton submarket dulled by increased development; Forsyth Pointe will bring ~1M SF in 2Q’22|Increase in concessions and subleasing as employers navigate post-pandemic work
9|221|Office|Suburban Maryland|Suburban Maryland: The Suburban Maryland market has trailed both D.C. and Northern Virginia this cycle, with significant losses in both government and FIRE employment. Developers have been focusing their attention in Northern Virginia, a market supported by both military spending and a growing tech presence. Amazon’s choice of Crystal City for its HQ2 location will likely favor the closer Northern Virginia submarkets of Alexandria / Arlington over Maryland’s Bethesda / Silver Spring. Suburban Maryland has seen a “flight to quality” trend in recent years, with developers focusing on the repositioning of underperforming Class B space. JBG Smith has been unwinding a large portion of its portfolio (~$770M) to fund new residential / office developments. The firm is currently constructing a 475-unit Class A apartment complex in Bethesda that is set to deliver in 1Q’19.

9|222|Office|Suburban Virginia|Suburban Virginia: The Suburban Virginia market is currently enjoying its time in the lime-light following Amazon’s HQ2 announcement, in which the company stated its intention to split their HQ2 location between Crystal City, VA and Long Island City, NY. The new office is expected to bring in 25k highly compensated positions and ~$2.5B of infrastructure investment. Plans include a new entrance to the Crystal City metro stop and a pedestrian bridge connecting Crystal City to the Reagan National Airport. Heavy renovation plans to the metro line are already underway in the region, strengthening the public transit system. Connectivity to the nation’s capital by means of the metro line is a large driver of tenant demand. However, temporary closures beginning summer ‘19 may disrupt  peak leasing in submarkets like Alexandria, as longer-commute times dissuade prospective residents from living outside D.C. Northern Virginia’s dominance in the cyber security / data services industries further boosts employment expectations, as technological advances require efficient security capacities. Development activity will likely see an uptick in the near term to accommodate the influx of workers; JBGS, the developer behind the relocation, is already planning a 750-unit mixed-use complex set to break ground in ’20. |Favorable regional demographics|Healthy growth in professional and business services|Silver Line expansion increases rail connectivity|Robust supply pipeline|Volatility in government budget / payrolls|Competition from DC / Maryland
9|225|Office|Tampa-St. Petersburg|Tampa-St. Petersburg: Tampa’s strong population growth is largely driven by retirees, which tempers otherwise bright fundamentals. Law firm Baker McKenzie will open an innovation hub that will bring ~300 jobs to the Central Tampa submarket, and the health and life science research presence around the Moffitt Cancer Center continues to grow with Swedish biotech company Vycellix choosing Tampa for its U.S HQ. Supply growth in Tampa surpasses the top market average with new deliveries centered in the Central Tampa and Central St. Petersburg submarkets. In Central Tampa, investors should be wary of Midtown Tampa and Water Street, 2 mixed-use developments currently under construction that will bring ~1.7k units to the submarket. While traditionally a favorite for its healthy demographics, the Southwest Tampa submarket is also facing more supply. The Westshore Marina District has started construction and will add >1k apartments and condos, retail space, and a marina to the Southwest submarket. With an economy driven by local services and overall less sensitive to Covid-19 risk, Tampa is expected to perform well over the next 5 years, resulting in above-average M-RevPAF growth expectations. Over the long term, Tampa’s population growth and status as a desirable coastal market mitigate the effects of oversupply to support healthy long-term NOI growth for Tampa apartments.|Office-using jobs in the market showed resilience in ’20, aided by a defensive financial services sector|Occupancy within the sector is ranked among our top markets because of historically low development|Favorable corporate tax environment and low business costs will likely strengthen Tampa’s office desirability|Subleasing activity in ’20 suggests office sector stress, Tampa has one of the highest WFH rates in the Sun Belt|Poor working age demographics, cost of living adjusted median income for millennials is among lowest of top markets|Inferior university backdrop and percentage of population with a college degree - particularly in eastern submarkets
9|1264|Office|Honolulu|Honolulu: As one of the world’s top tourist destinations, the Honolulu economy primarily relies on the leisure and hospitality sectors which have faced large recent headwinds due to Covid-19. The island’s isolated location and high-cost environment make it difficult for businesses to justify moving into the market, leading to limited employment growth in other sectors. The ever-rising cost of living has led to population declines in recent years, and much of the loss has been concentrated in the 34-and-below age group. Despite these negative tailwinds, limited supply insulates apartment fundamentals on the island. The strict entitlement and permitting processes, along with high land prices, make development time consuming and pricey. To make up for affordability issues on the island, the local government is working to ease supply barriers. Recent legislation (Bill 7) was approved in ‘19 in hopes of encouraging the development of more affordable housing for Honolulu residents. The new law allows higher density apartments to be built on lots of <20k SF in exchange for requirements to charge rates deemed affordable on at least 80% of the units. Douglas Emmett is also in the process of converting a ~490k SF office building into ~500 apartment units over the next few years in the Central Honolulu submarket. An unclear outlook for the Honolulu economy, out-migration, and easing supply barriers call for intermediate-term growth to remain among the lowest of the top markets, hindering the island’s risk-adjusted return expectations. |Douglas Emmett will be replacing ~460k SF of office with apartments as leases expire in the Downtown submarket|High barriers to entry limit supply growth on the island|Highest levels of office concentration Downtown, aiding the submarket’s demand profile|YoY office-using job growth has been negative since November ‘19|Isolated location makes connectivity to other markets difficult for businesses on the island|Talent pool limited by millennial out-migration and lower levels of educational attainment
9|1282|Office|Columbus|Columbus: While the capital of Ohio is economically outperforming its Midwest peers, decelerating job growth in the FIRE and TAMI sectors coupled with a lack of supply barriers limit long-term prospects for Columbus. The city’s strengths lie in the large presence of Fortune 500 companies that have helped attract young talent and greatly contributed to the metro’s economic growth. Ohio State University, one of the largest universities in the U.S., also provides a strong base of educated professionals (~40% of graduates stay in Columbus). Developers have been actively adding new supply to the metro as strong in-migration and business expansions have increased apartment demand. Most of the new supply is concentrated in the University / Downtown submarket, where demand for mixed-use space has accelerated. If job growth continues to meaningfully decline in high-paying industries, the significant supply pipeline may dampen future apartment fundamentals, especially as the long-term effects of Covid-19 are felt. Investors should also be wary of affordable single-family housing placing a cap on rent growth. Overall, Columbus’ educated workforce and millennial population are helping apartment demand, but low barriers to entry limit long-term NOI growth and return expectations.	|A business-friendly environment and no corporate tax attracts company headquarters such as Nationwide Insurance |A low WFH utilization rate lessens impact on sector fundamentals, specifically occupancy |Above-average college educated population as a result of a strong university presence |Steady outflow of office-using jobs in the TAMI sector reduces office demand |Low relative long-term rent growth potential in the West submarket |Below average Desirability Index score due to weak in-migration trends relative to top markets 
9|1316|Office|Dallas / Fort Worth|Dallas / Fort Worth: The sprawling DFW metro has many strong demand drivers but is still susceptible to large waves of new supply. DFW continues to be an attractive business destination as employers are drawn to the region’s business-friendly environment, affordability, and centralized location, and the quality of job growth has improved in recent years with higher paying finance and tech job growth gaining momentum.  Low physical and regulatory barriers to entry have resulted in inflated supply pipelines and a deluge of new deliveries. These units are being matched with robust demand, resulting in average intermediate-term M-RevPAF growth forecasts. Long-term NOI growth is negatively impacted by the ease with which new supply can be added to the market. A significant portion of new supply is focused in the northern neighborhoods of Plano / Frisco and in the University Park submarket. Given current pricing and the healthy intermediate outlook, returns are expected to be around the top market average. |25 Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in the metro (e.g., Southwest Airlines, AT&T, etc.)|Affordability and lower tax burden for corporations drives demand for space (e.g., CBRE, Uber, etc.)|Strong office-using job growth forecasted over the intermediate-term|Increased tenant risk from companies within the energy sector|Relaxed zoning laws and low supply barriers allows for development activity|Older stock poses a risk as higher quality assets are in favor over the near-term
9|1521|Office|D.C. Metro|D.C. Metro: D.C. Metro apartment fundamentals have lagged most major markets this cycle, though prospects are improving in the near term, the stability of public sector hiring should lead to a shallower trough in apartment rents and occupancy versus other coastal markets. Over the intermediate term, a highly-educated labor force and positive momentum on the TAMI job growth front bode well for apartment fundamentals. Amazon’s move to Crystal City will likely prove a win for local apartment owners as the firm will attract an influx of highly compensated employees. The new jobs associated with HQ2, which in total represent a 10% expansion of tech jobs for the market, are likely to be phased in over the course of ~10 years. Along with Crystal City, the Southwest Waterfront and Nationals Park neighborhoods continue to be hotbeds for new Class A product. Supply growth is expected to remain steady over the coming years, preventing a meaningful re-acceleration in rent growth (similar to most markets). As the pandemic exacerbates many large state and city deficits that will likely require significant tax hikes to resolve (e.g., NYC and NJ), D.C. stands to benefit as one of the few gateway markets not burdened by poor fiscal health. Uncertainty around government spending may continue to be a headwind for the area, but the D.C.

11|150|Strip Center|Atlanta|Atlanta: Atlanta’s pro-business environment continues to attract companies and drive steady job growth within the metro. In 3Q'19, BlackRock announced that its new innovation center will bring >1k tech jobs to the Northeast submarket, beginning in ’20. Google expanded its presence in Midtown in 4Q'19 while Microsoft announced its new Atlanta office, which will bring ~1.5k jobs to Midtown, in 2Q’20. The Midtown submarket, offering a walkable lifestyle adjacent to Georgia Tech, has garnered significant attention from developers with ~2k apartment units under construction. While overall supply growth in Atlanta is in line with the top market average, the Gwinnet submarket has seen outsized development. Cumberland and Buckhead remain favorable due to their relatively muted supply pipelines and strong demographics; Buckhead continues to attract millennials with its walkability, strong transport systems, and cultural amenities while residents seeking suburban living flock to the Cumberland submarket, located only 20 minutes from Downtown. Traffic congestion and poor infrastructure are still problematic across the metro, although the city and state plan to invest $2.5B to improve MARTA lines and offerings over the next 25 years. With healthy employment growth and an increasing tech presence, Atlanta boasts a strong long-term outlook and near-term M-RevPAF growth that bests most top markets.|Household income expected to outpace top markets, aided by business-friendly environment and tech sector|Above-average retail sales growth forecast through expectations for labor market to outperform|Growing leisure sector and rapid population growth serves as a tailwind for consumer spending|Ecommerce penetration will likely pick up in dense metros as consumer behavior shifts|Much of the current strip inventory is out of date, particularly in North Dekalb|Development expected to pick up in South DeKalb, around I-285 and near Kensington MARTA station, through ‘21
11|151|Strip Center|Austin|Austin: Strong asset value appreciation for Austin apartments has been driven by robust demand from both employment and population growth. Austin has become a major tech hub and destination for skilled, young workers that is fueled by a deep talent pool from local universities, a vibrant culture, and relative affordability. Upcoming expansion plans by brand-name employers bode well for job growth momentum. Apple’s $1 billion campus development  will bring 15k new jobs in the area by ’22. Facebook, Google, and Oracle, and now Tesla are also expanding their presence in the metro. This population boom has caused once-affordable home prices to surge, giving apartment owners more room to push rents. Rental demand anchored by the millennial cohort has been focused in the Downtown / Northwest submarkets, and the area around The Domain. New development has also been concentrated in these areas. The supply pipeline remains elevated, but demand is expected to allow for above-average M-RevPAF growth. Barriers to entry in Austin, while less than coastal markets, are the highest in Texas which will help support long-term rent growth. There is also growing evidence of NIMBYism in the area as residents and the city council have expressed concerns over increased traffic and rapidly rising home prices. Strong fundamentals, coupled with relatively attractive cap rates compared to markets with similar growth, drive attractive risk-adjusted returns.|Rapid population growth|Increased presence of employees working for Fortune 500 companies (e.g. Facebook, Google, Oracle, Apple, Tesla)|High median income and spending power per square foot drives demand for more space|High supply growth relative to the average market in the top 50|Lack of industry diversification among employers poses economic risk if sector-specific downturn occurs|Outsized presence of younger population could drive faster growth of ecommerce penetration
11|152|Strip Center|Baltimore|The Baltimore market remains an intriguing option for investors shying away from the increasingly modest going-in yields presented by other East Coast markets. Fueled by growth in the information and professional services sectors, future economic growth in Baltimore is likely to outpace that of many of its Eastern seaboard peers. Notably, a strengthening high-tech sector largely comprised of cybersecurity firms continues to spill over from the neighboring D.C. Metro, bolstered by a highly skilled local workforce and the presence of major universities such as Johns Hopkins and the University of Maryland. Various suburbs intend to reap the benefits of this wave of cybersecurity growth; the Merriweather District development hopes to create a “center of gravity in the cyberspace community” while transforming the landscape of downtown Columbia. Such development is not limited to suburbs, however, as the massive Port Covington project seeks to breathe new life into Baltimore City. Despite such efforts over the long term, current headwinds include high crime rates and severely entrenched urban poverty, rendering Baltimore City a less attractive region in which to live and work. Higher cap rates may attract some yield-oriented investors, but poor intermediate-term growth and a fairly restrained long-term outlook should be a drag on returns. |High initial yield contributes to above-average risk-adjusted expected returns |High median household incomes combined with relative affordability contribute to strong spending power per capita|Stable health care / government employment base lowers downside economic risk|Outsized number of permanent closures in ’20 will weigh on M-RevPAF growth, especially in the Baltimore City submarket|High unemployment and low household incomes in Baltimore City and Pikesville submarkets|Below-average job growth and income growth expectations impede increased future spending power
11|154|Strip Center|Boston|Boston: The market continues to attract an outsized share of knowledge-based workers as employers are drawn to a well-educated population anchored by a top university system. Employers like Amazon, Foundation Medicine, Klaviyo, and Google are expanding in or relocating to Boston, bringing thousands of high-paying jobs to the metro. Millennial population continues to grow as recent graduates chase these high-paying jobs. In addition to in-migration, apartment demand is supported by some of the highest home prices across top markets, delaying homeownership for many renters. A healthy demand backdrop combined with an average supply pipeline will help the city overcome short-term struggles brought on by the pandemic, leaving Boston among the strongest gateway markets for intermediate growth potential. Healthy demand can be found in Boston’s downtown submarkets given a desirable lifestyle and proximity to work. Investors should be aware of the “Imagine Boston 2030” master plan and its aim to make the market more affordable by ‘30 through increased mixed-use development which will add apartment inventory to the metro. Solid long-term growth prospects, should provide investors with attractive risk-adjusted returns relative to most metros.|Affluent population; income growth expected to remain strong in the intermediate term|High TAP scores across the market |Back Bay / Fin District, Cambridge, and Brookline / Newton submarkets benefit from dense populations|Long-term return expectations are muted by low going-in yields|High cost of living dampens discretionary spending |Limited population growth hinders near-term retail sales growth
11|156|Strip Center|New Jersey (Central)|New Jersey (Central): The Central New Jersey apartment market has proven a stable but low-growth market this past cycle. The long-term outlook remains underwhelming due to concerning fiscal health trends and sluggish employer growth. The state’s “Grow NJ” program, which provided tax incentives for companies that created or retained jobs in the region, had little success in Central New Jersey and finally expired in July ’19. The state’s concerning fiscal health (debt burden >$200B), which will likely be much worse following Covid-19, should deter investors as property tax increases to raise government funds would cut directly into the bottom line. Green Street estimates that a ~700 bp increase to the median resident’s non-federal tax burden is required to offset the state’s unfunded liabilities, which translates to an ~8% decline in after-tax income. Princeton University’s younger demographic provides steady rental demand for landlords in the Mercer / Princeton submarket, but the metro struggles to keep graduates from relocating to surrounding metros with better job prospects (e.g., New York, D.C., Boston). Stagnant population growth has pressured investors’ ability to push rents, and millennial out-migration forecasts will likely continue to weigh on long-term demand.|Wealthy population with high spending power drives demand|Growth in the wholesale and retail sector expected to be a large contributor to economic growth in the market|Low inventory per capita supports spending power|Poor intermediate-term NOI growth from weak fundamentals leads to subpar returns|Lack of large corporate expansions / relocations to the market|Concerning fiscal health may lead to tax hikes
11|158|Strip Center|Charlotte|Charlotte: Strong domestic in-migration and employment growth have provided nice tailwinds for apartment fundamentals. Young adults have flocked to North Carolina’s most populous metro, drawn by Charlotte’s diverse range of employment opportunities, relative affordability compared to other East Coast hubs, and a dynamic live / work / play environment. The quality of job growth has improved in recent years, fueled by the array of employers that operate in Charlotte and those that are choosing to expand in the market (e.g., Lowe’s, U.S. Bank, Honeywell). Developers have been active and there has been a focus on mixed-use development along the LYNX Blue Line metro, with a new delivery at seemingly every stop. In 4Q’19, Charlotte’s City Council voted to spend $50M for a transportation firm to design a 26-mile Silver Line light-rail connecting the East submarket to Uptown and westward into Gaston County, despite ongoing concerns about how the city will fund the ~$4B project. As competition for tenants increases, landlords have been forced to offer more amenitized space to differentiate their product. Supply growth across the metro is showing no signs of slowing, and though absorption has been healthy investors should remain cautious of the elevated supply pipeline over the next 5 years, especially if economic growth remains sluggish in the next few years. Demand in Midtown and Downtown should stack up favorably as young adults have demonstrated a strong propensity to rent in these submarkets. |Expectations for robust job recovery in ’21 driven by business services sector|Above-average retail sales growth and low cost of business environment relative to top markets|Affordable cost of living and FIRE sector job composition serve as favorable tailwinds for discretionary spending|Pandemic in ‘20 led to a sharp rise in West Charlotte vacancy, worsened by high crime rate / poor household income|Unfavorable population density outside of Central Charlotte|Heavy development pipeline as plans for 32k SF (~3% of stock) retail center unfolds in Southwest Charlotte through ‘21
11|160|Strip Center|Chicago|Chicago: The “Capital of the Midwest” exhibits stronger near-term apartment fundamentals than nearby Midwest markets, but Chicago still suffers from concerning long-term demographic and fiscal health trends. Owners are pressured by increasing tax liabilities from reassessed property values as the city / state try to alleviate fiscal woes. Additionally, a November ’20 ballot measure proposes graduated individual income tax rates between 4.95%-7.99%, changing from a current fixed rate of 4.95%. While increasing taxes hurts disposable income and has contributed to some out-migration, the modest silver lining is limited new supply in the market since developers are hesitant of the metro’s higher taxes and rising construction costs. Investors should be aware of the $6B Lincoln Yards master plan, which will phase in ~6k apartment units to the Lincoln Park / Old Town submarket over the intermediate term. In addition to fiscal issues, the metro suffers from millennial out-migration and unattractive employment trends, losing share to markets with higher-paying job opportunities. The wealthy population that resides in the Glencoe / Wilmette submarket, which falls outside of city limits (and thus outside of Chicago’s fiscal issues), pay some of the highest nominal rents across the market. Landlords have been able to consistently push rent in this submarket despite overall metro headwinds.|Robust TAP scores found in North, West, and Cook County submarkets|Muted supply pipeline through the intermediate term as development pauses for evolving shadow supply predicament|Affluent and educated suburban submarkets (e.g., West, North Cook County, Lake County)  set to outperform|High vacancies in an over-retailed market with outsized concentration in big box retail|Lack of landlord negotiating power and low intermediate growth contribute to well-below average returns|Falling CPPIs and expanding cap rates; market consistently trails top market average as underperformance continues
11|161|Strip Center|Cincinnati|Cincinnati: Cincinnati’s growth is broadly driven by its exposure to a few large corporate headquarters, including Kroger, Proctor & Gamble, and Macy’s. While large companies have helped propel job growth this last cycle, primarily in the finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE) sectors, a troubled manufacturing industry and lackluster population growth will likely weigh on apartment demand. Proximity to Columbus’ more stable job market hurts Cincinnati’s ability to attract young talent and prevent millennials from migrating. Very affordable single-family housing has also resulted in one of the highest homeownership rates relative to the top markets, which limits an investor’s ability to push apartment rents. One positive for the metro is Proctor and Gamble’s and Kroger’s strong quarterly earnings and forward-guidance in late ‘19, both of whom were facing challenges over the past few years. Despite an encouraging trajectory early in the year for P&G and Kroger, Covid-19 has disrupted future hiring plans for two of Cincinnati’s largest employers. In addition, Macy’s plans to slash ~3,900 corporate and management jobs as part of a restructuring plan will likely further dampen apartment fundamentals. Limited demand tailwinds, affordable homes, underwhelming demographics, and lagging population growth restrict the metro’s long-term NOI growth potential.	|Higher relative disposable incomes stemming from a lower cost of living|Below-average sales tax encourages consumer spending|High exposure to large corporate headquarters provides economic stability|Central / Midtown submarket have above-average TAP scores relative to other submarkets|The local economy has outsized exposure to struggling industries such as manufacturing|Low land costs lead to weak supply barriers that decrease pricing power over longer term
11|162|Strip Center|Cleveland|Cleveland: A lack of young talent and weak job growth point to a continuation of poor apartment fundamentals. Once a manufacturing powerhouse, Cleveland has failed to redefine itself as globalization and technological innovation continue to leave many Rust Belt cities behind. The city suffers from significant out-migration, which is expected to continue over the next 5 years led by a decline in young adults who are relocating for better opportunities. Cleveland’s lone bright spot and best hope for reversing momentum remains in health care. The Case Western Reserve University Medical School and the Cleveland Clinic are large providers of high-paying jobs and economic activity. Investments in the life sciences is underway at the Cleveland Clinic’s research centers that may help generate some growth. However, it remains doubtful that the health care sector’s job growth in isolation will be able to resuscitate the local economy.  The Downtown submarket is demonstrating emerging strength due to a modernization effort by the Downtown Cleveland Alliance to create an innovation district. Despite development initiatives to generate an increasingly vibrant downtown area, Cleveland still struggles to compete with more desirable Midwest markets.	|Health care sector supports local economy, expected to continue expanding in market|Stronger demographics in the West submarket lead to higher TAP scores|Lower cost of living increases discretionary spending for residents|Weak job growth prospects lead to lower income levels in the market|One of the lowest projected retail sales growth rates of the top markets|Continued population outflow weakens underlying demand
11|168|Strip Center|Denver|Denver: Denver continues to attract jobs from a diverse set of employment bases. YoY TAMI job growth  has been trending at an average of ~4% each month since the beginning of ’19. TAMI growth is supported by the in-migration of several startups and small tech firms, along with tech giants such as Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, and Apple. High-quality job opportunities, coupled with Denver’s desirable quality of life and access to nature, have attracted many young residents, making “The Mile-High City” a hot spot for millennial migration. Millennial demand has skyrocketed in trendy neighborhoods such as the LoHi / Highlands neighborhood in the Golden / Wheatridge submarket, and the RiNo Arts District in the Northeast submarket. Demand in the Downtown submarket is bolstered by the walkable, urban environment. Continued interest from affluent, highly-compensated millennials in these submarkets should allow for strong rent growth potential. The market’s low initial investment yields are offset by solid long-term growth, driving above-average risk-adjusted returns.|High TAP scores driven by high educational attainment and high incomes; TAMI and FIRE sectors boost incomes|Strong vacation travel; visitors to Denver spent $7B in ’19, twice that of comparable Salt Lake City|Retail sales growth is forecasted to outpace the Southwest and the nation through ‘25|Heavy millennial concentration may result in higher-than-average ecommerce growth |High state and local sales taxes contribute to increasing cost of living|Gallagher Amendment repeal may increase tax burden for individual households
11|169|Strip Center|Detroit|Detroit: Optimism in the “Motor City” is fading as employment figures weaken and investment in the market is failing to provide substantial and sustainable improvement. Economic growth is expected to lag the rest of the Midwest through the intermediate term, even with substantial investments from billionaire Dan Gilbert and national automotive companies. The metro is hindered by continued dependence on stagnating industries and fails to make a meaningful economic shift toward higher-growth industries. TAMI jobs have seen consistent net outflow for years, and overall employment growth in Detroit ranks among the lowest across top markets (~35% of the population lives below the poverty line). The lack of well-paying jobs hampers in-migration as new graduates and millennials choose more desirable markets that offer better compensation to start their careers. Tepid demand from minimal population and job growth mixed with low supply barriers provide a weak intermediate-term outlook for the apartment sector. Additionally, rising construction costs are leading developers to rethink their plans or ditch them all together as rents cannot keep up with increasing development costs. This is exemplified in projects like the East Jefferson Meijer, originally planned as a 213-unit mixed-use apartment / small-format grocer development that was abandoned in favor of a larger-format grocery store and parking lot. While the market has improved substantially since its bankruptcy in ‘13, the outlook still looks bleak.|Northwest submarkets benefit from relatively higher median household income and lower unemployment rates|Low cost of living increases disposable income |The Birmingham / Troy submarket screens the most attractive for long-term rent growth potential|Already suffering from a weak economy pre-Covid, Detroit is now even more at risk to increased store closures|Population loss will continue to be a major headwind for future consumption in the metro|Significant shadow supply, poor demographics, and subpar economic growth limits long-term growth potential
11|171|Strip Center|Fairfield County|Fairfield County: Statewide fiscal concerns and tepid job growth continue to suppress apartment fundamentals in Fairfield County. Outsized municipal debt and unfunded liabilities have forced higher tax rates, a major determinant for several corporate HQ departures over the past few years (e.g., GE to Boston, Starwood to Miami). Fairfield County has not been able to attract any large relocations to backfill those gaps left behind. Meanwhile, the metro continues to face the headwinds of a shift from active to passive investment management, though FIRE employment improved in '18 after 22 consecutive months of YoY job declines. The market serves as a suburban living alternative to Manhattan which attracts more families looking to live in homes than rent apartments. Millennial population growth continues to decelerate as more prefer to live closer to Manhattan-based jobs.  While limited new construction will support apartment rent growth, unfavorable demographics and fiscal health issues should handcuff long-term NOI growth.|Very favorable demographics; high earners|Spillover demand from NYC|Amazon and Google bringing jobs to the region|Continued concerns over fiscal health of state|SoNo Collection adding a block of supply in 2H‘19|Losing high wage jobs; SALT tax reform hurts high earners
11|172|Strip Center|Fort Lauderdale|Fort Lauderdale: Moderate job and population growth paired with middle-of-the-pack supply growth create a mixed outlook for Fort Lauderdale apartments. While tourism has historically been the primary economic growth driver, Fort Lauderdale’s economy is diversifying with a promising life sciences sector and steady job growth in the FIRE and professional / business services industries. The Fort Lauderdale, Plantation, and Miramar / Pembroke Pines submarkets have seen the most supply as developers seek opportunity north of Miami. Las Olas Boulevard in the Fort Lauderdale submarket has attracted significant development due to its walkable lifestyle and downtown feel. Las Olas Walk, a mixed-use development, will add ~1,200 luxury rental units to the submarket by late '20. For favorable demographics and a limited supply pipeline, investors should look to the Davie submarket, which boasts the wealthiest and most educated residents in the metro.  While Fort Lauderdale’s coastal location and steady job growth support a healthy rent profile, the market’s outlook is moderated by condo oversupply in the near term and a lack of meaningful supply barriers over the long term. |Key retailers (e.g. Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods) growing their presence in the market |Boca Raton submarket benefits from the metro’s most educated population and supply barriers on the coast|Affordable alternative for residents relative to Miami|Prevalent hurricane / natural disaster risk increases cap-ex|Weak income growth across the market|Cruise traffic, responsible for bringing ~4M people to the metro annually, to remain muted due to Covid-19
11|177|Strip Center|Houston|Houston: After being impacted heavily by the energy bust in ’15, Houston’s economy is still recovering. A silver lining of the energy recession is a slightly more diversified economy; the health care sector has seen growth, exemplified by Texas Medical Center becoming the world’s largest medical complex. Petrochemical manufacturing and other downstream energy activities have also experienced outsized growth. Although Houston has diversified its economy in recent years, the 1Q’20 collapse in oil prices and Covid-19 pandemic have presented additional challenges for the market. A large amount of supply was delivered directly into the energy recession and is still being absorbed by the market, as evidenced by below-average occupancy rates. Now, given the current uncertain economic environment, the already-present vacancy rate troubles will likely be prolonged. The current supply pipeline, while not massive, is large enough to continue to put downward pressure on intermediate-term M-RevPAF growth. A lack of zoning laws and a sprawling metroplex provide little regulatory or physical barriers to entry, suppressing long-term growth. Investors should look west towards the Montrose / River Oaks and Museum submarkets where there are higher incomes, more expensive housing, and elevated rents, but in aggregate expect below-average long-term returns, as higher going in yields are offset by lackluster long-term NOI growth potential.|High going-in yield and NOI growth forecast results in attractive return expectations|Nearly all TAP Scores along the western half of the metro are >80|Western submarkets are densely populated and have higher rates of residents with college degrees|Pandemic-induced decline in occupancy rates severely reduce M-RevPAF growth outlook|Low spending power PSF, partly due to elevated unemployment rates in the eastern submarkets|Lack of zoning regulations allows developers to significantly increase supply
11|178|Strip Center|Indianapolis|Indianapolis: The capital of the “Hoosier State” has little to offer apartment investors in terms of long-term rent growth, as structural headwinds stemming from poor demographics and minimal supply constraints create a challenging environment. The job growth occurring is largely seen in the warehouse and manufacturing sectors which, combined with an outflow of high-paying TAMI jobs, limits income growth potential. While a quicker Covid-19 recovery is expected in Indianapolis over the next few years, the market should revert to below-average long-term growth relative to other top markets. Rent growth is constrained by affordable homeownership options available throughout the metro, and despite low regulatory and physical barriers, supply growth screens below average. Most of the development occurring in the metro can be found in the Downtown and Southwest submarkets. Meanwhile, the surrounding suburban submarkets exhibit the highest median incomes in the metro and have had more success in attracting investors (e.g., Spruce Capital, who purchased a ~1k unit suburban portfolio in early ’20). Though strong intermediate-term growth and high going-in yields screen attractive on the surface, affordable home prices allow renters to quickly transition into homeowners, hurting long-term rent growth potential.|Higher TAP scores in the Carmel / Westfield submarket due to higher household incomes and education levels|Below-average cost of living increases discretionary income for its residents |A tax friendly environment|Weak economic growth forecasts through the intermediate term compared to other Midwest markets|Automation and globalization threaten to harm the manufacturing reliant economy|Steady outflow of high paying industries contributes to low median household income
11|179|Strip Center|Jacksonville|Jacksonville: While healthy population and job growth bode well for apartment demand in Jacksonville, supply growth concerns weigh heavily on long-term rent growth potential. The Southside submarket is seeing the bulk of oncoming supply as it has both cheap land for development and is home to a younger and more educated population. The Arlington and Downtown submarkets are also seeing significant supply growth, particularly as the city and developers try to revitalize downtown to attract and retain more residents.  Notable developments include the District, a $600M mixed-use development on the Southbank that will add ~1k residential units, a hotel, and a marina to the metro. Near the Southbank, San Marco is seeing substantial development with ~800 units to be added by '21. Investors should look to the Beaches submarket, which benefits from the market’s highest rents and limited supply along the coast. Strong population and employment growth will help Jacksonville weather the upcoming recession reasonably well, leading to above-average near-term M-RevPAF growth; however, the lack of any meaningful barriers to supply outside of the coast restrains long-term rent growth potential.   |Favorable cost of living / personal income tax environment strengthens discretionary spending|Market desirability / in-migration will aid retail sales growth through ‘25|Low corporate income tax with lower market input costs will likely weigh down on retail overhead spending|Below-average rent growth expectations through ’25 largely due to weak household income backdrop|Supply growth exceeded top markets by ~100 bps in ’20, hampering occupancy levels going forward|Low concentration of skilled labor places pressure on household income growth
11|180|Strip Center|Kansas City|Kansas City: A shallower trough in Covid-induced job losses versus most markets and solid expected intermediate growth are bright spots for Kansas City, but the metro’s longer-term return prospects continue to be hampered by structural headwinds. While the market’s supply pipeline remains below-average, new units will likely struggle to be absorbed in the face of subpar income and population growth. Employers such as the USDA and CarMax have chosen to establish new operations within the market, attracted by low costs of living and doing business. Existing companies such as Cerner, Garmin, and Burns McDonnel have all announced that they are expanding their footprint in the metro with plans to add over 18k combined jobs in the next few years (~3% expansion of the existing non-farm workforce). While hiring by these companies and efforts to improve local transportation infrastructure may help the metro recover from the Covid-19 fallout more quickly over the intermediate term, the metro’s continued inability to draw high-paying employers results in unfavorable long-term growth, driving below-average risk-adjusted returns.|Working age population growth expected to outperform Midwest region|Strong TAP scores for centers in the Overland Park submarket|Sound metro fiscal health|Very low spending power PSF|Population growth expected to underperform|Overall lack of high-paying industries, TAMI and FIRE sectors are missing
11|182|Strip Center|Las Vegas|Las Vegas: Above-average job growth has bolstered Las Vegas apartment fundamentals in recent years, but this trend has dramatically reversed with Covid-19’s outsized hit on the hospitality and leisure industries. The market now faces all-time high levels of unemployment, among the worst of the top markets. The economy’s heavy reliance on the tourism and hospitality industries has proven to be an extreme risk, and its health will greatly depend on the future progression of the virus and the availability of a vaccine. Though jobs are expected to return in the future, and the Allegiant Stadium completion is expected to create ~1.2k new jobs, apartment demand will continue to face long-term fundamental headwinds created by a cheap single-family market that incentivizes homeownership and lower-paying job growth. As residents continue to migrate from California, many immediately look at investing in a home as housing prices are very affordable relative to the high-cost, West Coast markets. A strong focus on single family development has kept apartment supply in check, a positive for owners, but very low going-in yields combined with an uncertain path of recovery over the long-term limit investors’ return potential.|No income tax boosts spending power for residents|As the gaming capital of the U.S., tourism should return post Covid and aid a quicker return of retail sales|High going-in yields drive above-average return prospects for the market|One of the few top markets with meaningful supply growth; pipeline concentrated in the Southwest submarket|Job growth is in low-paying, temporary industries which limits median HHI growth|Very low TAP scores and low spending power PSF throughout all submarkets
11|185|Strip Center|Long Island|Long Island: After underwhelming job growth through much of the recent upcycle, Long Island’s local economy was one of the worst performers among the top  markets following the onset of the recession. The health care and education sectors, which have historically been a bright spot for job growth, experienced net declines throughout 1H’20, though the metro’s large government sector (~15% of jobs) held up relatively well. Long Island’s apartment demand generally benefits from New York City spillover, but this effect may be limited in the near term as the city grapples with economic fallout from the pandemic. It remains to be seen if tech growth in NYC will continue at its recent pace given the city’s fiscal issues and the acceleration in working from home, but already-announced expansions in ’19 (e.g., Google, Facebook, and Amazon) will provide incremental apartment demand. However, this will largely be confined to NYC’s urban core and Long Island submarkets in close proximity to Manhattan (i.e., Hempstead). Nearly 30% of Long Island’s population is between the ages of 45-64, among the highest across the top markets. As such, the region will likely never be a top destination for apartment investors due to its older, homeowning demographic, but a light supply pipeline should mitigate the job loss impact on rent growth to an extent.|Market appeals to affluent families; low crime rate and high school ratings|TAP scores >80 on average bode well for demand profile|Historically tight supply growth supports fundamentals|Soft local economy; relies on spillover from NYC|Worsening state-level fiscal health may lead to future tax hikes|Low going-in yields drive below-average risk-adjusted returns
11|186|Strip Center|Los Angeles|Los Angeles: The LA apartment market is comprised of many cities across a vast geographic area and contains some of the highest barrier-to-entry submarkets in the nation (e.g., Santa Monica, Malibu Hills). Demand for housing in LA continues to exceed available supply, putting pressure on renters in a high-barrier, landlord-favored market. In 2H’19, AB 1482 was enacted by Governor Newsom implementing statewide rent control for renewal offers on apartments older than 15 years. The law will be in effect from January ’20 until January ‘30. Additionally, Prop 21, a measure to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, will appear on the November ’20 ballot (a similar ballot measure failed in ’18), reigniting concern amongst landlords that local governments may be able to enact more restrictive forms of rent control. Prospective investors should look west of the I-405 freeway, known as the Westside, for the strongest long-term rent growth potential as these highly desirable and supply-constrained submarkets are supported by healthy demographics and solid high-paying job growth. Los Angeles is one of the most highly regulated markets in the U.S., as geographical barriers, NIMBYism, and elevated construction costs keep supply in check. Tight supply dynamics and robust demand will continue to contribute to strong long-term NOI growth for the market.|Affluent coastal Westside submarket|Amazon continues to open grocery stores across the market-most recently in North Hollywood in 4Q'20|Natural supply constraints have resulted in limited development historically |Increase in minimum wage in 3Q'20 and high state taxes hurt bottom line|High cost of living limits disposable income|Local and state policies tend to be unfriendly to business
11|187|Strip Center|Louisville|Louisville: With a regional focus and high employment concentration in manufacturing and other traditionally low-growth industries, Louisville’s economic prospects remain muted as compared with its Midwest peers. Some job growth has occurred in the metro, but mainly in the low-wage manufacturing and wholesale sectors; employment growth in the higher-paying TAMI and FIRE industries has been virtually nonexistent. A lack of demand stemming from minimal job growth is exacerbated by the metro’s relatively less desirable lifestyle, evident by minimal millennial population inflow. Demand headwinds and lack of  supply barriers limit a landlord’s ability to push rent. Additionally, the market’s low cost of living  drives homeownership relative to other metros, further hindering long-term rent growth. Like much of the Midwest, high going-in yields appear attractive, but there is little upside as the metro’s underwhelming outlook over the intermediate and long term limit return expectations.|Northeast and Oldham / Shelby County submarkets benefit from a relatively high median household income |Virtually non-existent supply growth leaves some room for potential rent growth upside in the near-term|Low cost of living helps to boost disposable income for those in higher-paying management / health care roles|Weak demographic and below-average population growth will weigh on the long-term outlook in most submarkets|Given the lack of retail demand, landlords may find it very challenging / expensive to backfill vacating tenants|Employment growth is primarily concentrated in the lower-paying manufacturing industries
11|188|Strip Center|Memphis|Memphis: The Memphis economy continues to miss out on the wave of growth in the technology and professional services industries that has propelled other southern metros. Concentrated in the trade and manufacturing sectors, Memphis’s undiversified and stagnant economy establishes a low ceiling on rent growth as high-paying jobs are few and far between. One of the few strengths of the markets lies in its low cash flow volatility, bolstered in part by a handful of Fortune 500 HQs. As the economy continues to find its footing amidst an on-going recession, Memphis’s low tech exposure contributes to a near-term M-RevPAF growth prospect that is expected to slightly outperform our top market average. TAMI and FIRE employment bases in Memphis are small and growing at a meager pace. Demographics in the ‘Home of Blues’ also bode poorly, as population growth significantly lags that of other southern metros and low-to-middle income households comprise a larger share of the market than the national average. Poor market fundamentals and struggling demographics, compounded by an active supply pipeline, present headwinds that render Memphis’ return profile among the least attractive in the country.|Incentives (e.g., tax credits, employee training, etc.) offered to businesses to operate in Memphis add appeal to the market|The eastern submarkets (Germantown, Cordova, Raleigh/Bartlett) have high TAP Scores|Low cash flow volatility provides stability during downturns |Median household income below top market average for submarkets west of Germantown and Cordova|Low spending power PSF|Minimal population and employment growth driven by industry concentration in lower-paying occupations
11|189|Strip Center|Miami|Miami: Miami’s business-friendly environment and cultural amenities support healthy demographics and long-term apartment fundamentals. Since '13, Miami has seen domestic out-migration, largely to other Florida metros, as some residents are priced out of the growing city; however, international immigrants and high-earners seeking low taxes have driven steady per-capita income growth (average income of a person moving to Miami has exceeded those leaving). Miami’s low-tax environment has also attracted a growing tech / finance presence and solid job growth in the metro. Elevated supply, largely in the Downtown, Opa-Locka, and Miami Beach submarkets, remains a concern but is outweighed by strong demand growth, resulting in a healthy near-term M-RevPAF growth forecast. In the Downtown submarket, the trendy Wynwood and the Design District neighborhoods are seeing notable supply in response to their popularity with millennials, while Little Haiti has been pegged as the next neighborhood to gentrify. Investors should also take note of Miami Worldcenter, a mixed-use project that will add ~1.9k new apartment units to the Downtown submarket by '21. Brickell remains a favorite submarket for its central location and strong demographics while Coral Gables stands out for its minimal supply pipeline. As a desirable metro with favorable demographics, Miami’s long-term rent growth potential for apartments is among the best of our top markets. 	|Brightline train system solidifies metro as regional capital and will connect metro to Orlando by ’21|The Everglades and Biscayne Bay act as supply barriers|Many wealthy communities with ample disposable income|Publix, the leading grocer in the region, often negotiates one-sided lease terms (flat rent for years)|Tourism still critical to economy and likely to remain muted in ’21|High cap-ex due to hurricanes and flooding	
11|191|Strip Center|Minneapolis|Minneapolis: Despite a number of large, stable employers, a full construction pipeline is weighing on Minneapolis’ intermediate rent growth outlook. Long-term advantages for the market include an outsized presence of S&P 500 companies and an educated labor force from nearby universities. However, local health care employment growth decelerated meaningfully throughout ’19 and bears watching moving forward. Local housing policy changes are further complicating the picture for apartment investors; Minneapolis’ “2040 Comprehensive Plan” upzones the majority of the city and effectively decreases supply barriers for much of the market. Furthermore, inclusionary zoning efforts are currently underway, intending to mandate that a portion of newly developed units be set aside as affordable housing. Currently, an interim plan is in place with the intention of more robust legislation being enacted. Elevated new supply and tepid employment growth over the coming years result in below-average market rent growth and weak long-term growth estimates.|Well-educated population base bolstered by large corporations and university systems|Above-average median household income and lower cost of living supports high spending power PSF |Lack of traffic congestion aides accessibility and demand|Permanent closures of stores and restaurants will weigh heavily on M-RevPAF growth, notably in the Central submarket|Large millennial presence relative to the top markets may lead to increased online sales penetration, hurting local retail|A few new developments set to complete in late ’20 and early ’21 could place additional strain on retail absorption
11|192|Strip Center|Nashville|Nashville: Nashville’s educated workforce, relative affordability, and significant population growth have attracted large companies to the metro. Alliance Bernstein is relocating its global headquarters, which will bring ~1,050 jobs to Nashville, and Amazon plans to bring another ~5,000 jobs to its new downtown operations hub, both of whom began hiring in '19 and will continue to hire through '24. The meaningful job growth over the past couple years has been a positive tailwind for apartment fundamentals. As rents climbed over the past several years during this local economic boom, regulators have altered zoning laws that allow for more developments in the urban core, leading to increased supply. The meaningful new supply is driving below-average M-RevPAF growth expectations despite significant in-migration and job growth. Nashville also benefits from a leading health care industry; 17 publicly traded health care companies are headquartered in the city, which supports high-paying jobs and economic stability. One caution facing apartment demand is the high homeownership rate outside of the Downtown and Airport submarkets.  While a healthy supply pipeline and high homeownership rate pose some threats to apartment fundamentals, the stable health care industry and significant population growth provides investors with solid long-term growth potential.|An increasing number of businesses moving to the area; AllianceBernstein adding >1k new high paying jobs in ‘21|The culture surrounding music attracts a young population as well as tourism spending; in ’19 tourists spent $7.5B|Relatively high going-in yields combined with strong LT growth expectations drive attractive return prospects |Younger demographics boost ecommerce usage higher than neighboring markets; decreasing in-person demand |Suburban market makeup leads to lower population density outside of CBD|Low barriers to supply
11|195|Strip Center|New York|New York: As the epicenter of the U.S. pandemic, New York faced steep job losses and deteriorating apartment fundamentals in the first half of ‘20. Finance remains the backbone of New York’s economy, and though not immune from layoffs, fared better than most industries in 1H’20. Growing tech interest in the city of late is a bright spot for apartment demand, with Facebook, Google, and Amazon all announcing large-scale expansions in ’19 (>20k jobs collectively). However, it remains to be seen if tech companies will modify pre-COVID plans following the acceleration in working from home. NYC would be a relative loser to lower-cost metros in a world where remote working becomes widely adopted. New York’s budget deficits worsened following the pandemic, and now require an estimated  ~600 bps increase to the median renter’s tax burden to cover the shortfall, which could accelerate recent outmigration. Asking rents fell precipitously in 1H’20 (~-10% YoY) and leasing activity was accompanied by a notable rise in concessions (~50% of new leases included concessions as of June ‘20). Just as investors began to wrap their heads around the expansive rent control laws passed in June ’19 by the state, transaction markets froze in 2Q’20 due to uncertainty surrounding asset prices, which have likely fallen double-digits.. A favorable supply outlook remains a silver lining for NYC, but apartment investors face significant headwinds in the coming years and a less-favorable long-term outlook in a post-COVID world. |Exceptional TAP scores in Manhattan driven by strong demographics |Muted supply growth allows owners to maintain elevated rents|Wealthy consumer base with significant spending power|Poor business environment and rising tax potential in near term leads out-migration of some employers and residents|Peak tourism levels in ’19 will take time to recover|Declining occupancies from market and sector headwinds drag on subpar intermediate-term growth
11|196|Strip Center|Norfolk / Hampton Roads|Norfolk/Hampton Roads: The Norfolk / Hampton Roads market has experienced instability in recent years as the region’s reliance upon shipbuilding and government sector employment has taken a sizeable hit due to fiscal budget volatility and waning demand for shipbuilding. It is still unclear whether trade conflict with China will escalate and adversely affect market fundamentals. Steady growth in professional and business services has helped offset declines in government employment. Norfolk has the unique benefit of being a military town, as many military service members provide a foundation for the renter population. Local politicians have noted the need for increased retention of young adults to boost the regional economy and have spearheaded several initiatives to increase its cultural appeal. The efforts haven’t resulted in any major relocations, but the development of Ferguson’s new 8-story corporate HQ in Newport News, which was heavily subsidized by the city, provides anecdotal evidence that the government is ready and willing to sponsor local businesses. Retention of young adults will be critical to both the Norfolk / Hampton Roads economy as well as for renter demand. |Moderate income growth projections|Affordability boosts disposable income|Seasonal tourism benefits coastal markets|Potential for increased grocer shadow supply|Government volatility and struggling shipbuilding sector|Inability to attract large corporate relocations
11|197|Strip Center|New Jersey (Northern)|New Jersey (Northern): Outsized job losses and subpar population growth pressure apartment fundamentals in Northern New Jersey. The metro serves as a cheaper alternative to Manhattan, especially in the urban Hudson County, but spillover demand from NYC has yet to translate into strong M-RevPAF growth. Several submarkets, including Hoboken and Jersey City, may begin to benefit from proximity to high-paying job growth across the river in Hudson Yards. The rise in work from home may accelerate this phenomenon, but it remains to be seen whether renters would rather flee NYC’s urban core for the cheaper NJ region, or instead opt to leave the NY-NJ area altogether given New Jersey’s dire fiscal health profile (~700bp tax increase required to cover the state’s unfunded liabilities). Future job forecasts remain underwhelming, but M-RevPAF growth should prove less sensitive to the economy in the near term. The expiration of the “Grow NJ” tax incentive program in ’19 dealt another blow to the region as the state has yet to find a replacement despite its moderate success in attracting relocations to the northern part of the state. Without tax incentives, Northern New Jersey will likely continue to shed jobs to more affordable metros, as companies are enticed by lower costs of business and faster-growing labor pools. Rent growth has lagged the top markets following elevated deliveries in ’17 and ’18, but the current supply pipeline should allow fundamentals to play catch-up in the intermediate term, resulting in a modest return profile.|High spending power and dense population support intermediate-term rent growth|More affordable alternative to NYC with higher risk-adjusted returns|Stronger TAP scores relative to surrounding markets (e.g., NJC, PHI, NYC)|Soft local economy with steep job losses lead a slow economic recovery post-pandemic|Significant fiscal health and pension funding issues may lead to tax increases|Bergen County’s “blue laws” restrict retail sales on Sundays
11|198|Strip Center|Oakland-East Bay|Oakland-East Bay: While the East Bay has often been overlooked by institutional capital in past cycles, exceptionally low cap rates and softening fundamentals in neighboring Bay Area markets could shift additional interest to the relatively higher going-in yields in Oakland. Though still in the early innings, if the current work from home trend continues to accelerate, Oakland could be a relative winner as renters seek cheaper alternatives to San Francisco and Silicon Valley. Near-term growth forecasts reflect slightly stronger performance relative to its Bay Area peers as a result of these developing trends. Employer interest in Oakland has grown in recent years with multiple companies (e.g., Facebook and Microsoft) expressing interest in the area, a trend that should contribute to healthy population growth. In late ’19,  Facebook announced plans to increase their footprint in the market to upwards of ~1.3M SF of office space, which appears to be moving forward as planned. Increasingly strict California regulations and NIMBYism throughout the market keep the development pipeline lower than average. The Downtown submarket, however, should continue to see elevated deliveries in the near and intermediate term as a result of its proximity to public transit and its walkability, making it an appealing location for young renters and employees commuting into San Francisco. Though going-in yields remain low, healthy intermediate- and long-term NOI growth contribute to returns that rank among the top of the pack.  |Income growth forecast remains above average with tech companies continuing to increase their presence in the market|Elevated disposable income levels |Above-average retails sales growth forecast|North Contra Costa submarket long-term growth potential weighs on the market as a whole|Above-average job losses caused by the recession |Risk-adjusted returns expected to trail the top market average
11|201|Strip Center|Orange County|Orange County: Healthy income growth and limited development have been the key drivers of Orange County’s improving apartment fundamentals in recent years. Job growth in Orange County has been mediocre of late, but the region enjoys a diversified workforce led by notable companies like Walt Disney, Boeing, and The Irvine Company. Because of the market’s housing costs, which are amongst the highest in the nation, residents are often forced to rent, creating a tailwind for apartment demand. California recently enacted a series of bills intended to address the state’s affordability issues, which may make it incrementally easier to develop apartments; however, multifamily permitting activity growth has consistently slowed over the last 3 years. In 2H’19, AB 1482 was enacted by Governor Newsom implementing statewide rent control for renewal offers on apartments that are older than 15 years. The law will be in effect beginning in January ’20 until January ‘30. Additionally, Prop 21, a measure to amend the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, will appear on the November ’20 ballot (a similar ballot measure failed in ’18), reigniting fear amongst landlords that local governments may be able to enact more restrictive forms of rent control. Investors should also be cognizant of The Irvine Company, which controls much of the region’s inventory and often influences market rents.|Highly dense and wealthy local population |Natural supply constraints - limited development historically |Strong demographics and university presence |Rising levels of minimum wage and state taxes hurt bottom line|High cost of living limits disposable income|Local and state policies tend to be unfriendly to business
11|202|Strip Center|Orlando|Orlando: Orlando is the most visited destination in the country with >70M annual visitors. With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, international travel has halted, damaging Orlando’s tourism-based economy and driving the unemployment rate to be among the worst of top markets in the early innings of the downturn. In recent years, Florida's business-friendly environment and the growth of the University of Central Florida have brought higher-wage jobs, such as professional services and health care, to the market, providing some insulation from Covid-19 fallout. Supply growth in Orlando is among the highest of top markets with the Southwest, South Central, and Maitland / Winter Park submarkets seeing the brunt of oncoming supply. Notable developments include downtown’s Creative Village, where UCF and Valencia’s shared campus opened in the summer of '19, bringing >7k students to downtown with long-term plans for ~15k students and >1.5k apartment units in the development. Despite supply growth concerns, investors should look to Maitland / Winter Park and South Central, particularly Thornton Park, for some of the market’s highest rents. Ultimately, investors should expect challenged near-term fundamentals as Orlando faces a tough recovery and struggles to absorb an elevated supply pipeline. In the long term, exceptional job and population growth create a healthy outlook for Orlando’s rent growth potential, though cap rates have compressed meaningfully in the market pre-Covid-19, tempering long-term return potential. |Orlando’s weather, affordability, and amenities have attracted strong millennial in-migration|Robust population growth paired with the metro’s affordability supports strong retail sales growth|Kroger and Sprouts Farmers Market are both expanding their presence, challenging dominant grocer Publix|Income growth among the lowest of top markets|Metro’s outlook through the Covid-19 pandemic is moderated by its concentration in hospitality|The Southwest Orange submarket, close to Orlando’s theme parks, to suffer from muted tourism
11|203|Strip Center|Palm Beach|Palm Beach: With population growth forecasts that best its South Florida peers and many top markets, Palm Beach is gradually evolving from a sleepy retirement town to an up-and-coming metro. Attracted to the market’s amenities, affordability, and low taxes, financial and business services companies have relocated to the metro while the hospitality and health care industries have also seen consistent growth. Virgin Trains USA now connects Palm Beach to Miami and will connect Palm Beach to Orlando in coming years. Supply growth, centered in the West Palm Beach, Lake Worth, and Boca Raton submarkets remains elevated, but has moderated after a spike in ‘17. Investors should look to the Boca Raton East submarket, which stands out for having the most educated population and the highest rents in the metro. Strong growth forecasts and a desirable lifestyle bode well for Palm Beach, ranking it above most top markets in terms of long-term rent growth potential and near-term M-RevPAF growth expectations. 	|High concentration of wealthy residents with >70k millionaire households|Infrastructure improvements from Brightline trains to decrease traffic and congestion|The Boca Raton submarket benefits from strong demographics and NIMBYism which restricts supply growth|Concentration of retirees, ~25% of the population - more than any other top market, burdens average household income|Reliant on seasonal and cyclical tourism industry|High cap-ex reserves due to hurricane risk and increased flooding in recent years
11|204|Strip Center|Philadelphia|Philadelphia: Philadelphia’s affordability versus other major East Coast markets (e.g., New York, D.C.) is a draw for some renters, but underwhelming job growth expectations sets the stage for below-average apartment fundamentals. The region’s large education and health care presence (e.g., University of Pennsylvania, Jefferson Healthcare system) provides stable employment, and a rapidly-growing life sciences industry has been a bright spot in Philly’s otherwise tepid economy, attracting strong venture capital inflows to the city (~$2.5B in ’19). The influx of tech funding paired with an abundance of local research facilities is expected to drive above-average income growth. The city’s punitive tax structure and unfriendly business environment largely limits major corporate relocations to the metro, and most cities that do set up shop choose to do so in the suburbs where taxes are less onerous. As such, there is a disconnect between where typical apartment renters live (CBD) and where the job growth is concentrated (suburbs). Investments in the city center and a drastically reduced crime rate have improved the city’s ability in retaining young talent (25-34 age cohort population growth has outpaced the overall average), but total population trends still prove worrisome. Philly’s capital flows are better than the city’s historic record, driven by smaller investors expanding outside of the surrounding metros in search of higher going-in yields.|Pockets of affluence boost TAP Scores in certain submarkets (e.g., King of Prussia, Lower Merion, Horsham)|Strong suburban purchasing power|Diverse economy supports stable income growth|Concerning population growth trends|Elevated vacancies and weak pricing power will likely hurt M-RevPAF growth in the near term|Outsized number of small business closures in Old City in ‘20; landlords may have trouble backfilling vacant space
11|205|Strip Center|Phoenix|Phoenix: Phoenix apartment fundamentals are bolstered by top-ranked job and population growth expectations. As a low-cost alternative to major California markets, Phoenix continues to draw residents from its neighbors to the west. Infosys, an IT services company, will move into the newly-delivered Novus Innovation Corridor in the North Tempe submarket once offices are able to reopen and intend to bring ~1k jobs to Phoenix by ’23. As additional companies are attracted to Tempe, apartment demand in the North and South Tempe submarkets should increase due to the walkable, urban amenities, and access to various transit alternatives. The Roosevelt Row (RoRo) neighborhood in the Downtown submarket is an up-and-coming neighborhood that is growing in popularity. Demand in Phoenix is expected to continue outpacing the high levels of supply for now, leading to relatively high levels of near-term M-RevPAF growth. Over longer periods of time, supply will likely catch up with demand, resulting in average long-term growth prospects. |Healthy near-term retail sales growth expectations are supported by strong population growth forecasts|Long-term return expectations are aided by above-average going-in yields and long-term growth forecasts|As a growing leisure-travel destination, tourism spending should increase in the market|Wealth is concentrated in very few submarkets (e.g., Scottsdale) with mediocre spending power in the market|Low barriers to entry; new supply primarily concentrated in the Mesa and Chandler / Gilbert submarkets|Weaker TAP scores in the Mesa, Midtown, and West Valley submarkets
11|206|Strip Center|Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh: Investors should exhibit cautious optimism when considering the “Steel City’s” apartment sector. While the Pittsburgh economy lags nearby East Coast metros due to its dependence on low-growth industries, a strong university system supports the nascent tech industry that is slowly gaining traction in the metro. Though employers like Apple, Facebook, and Google recruit from these universities that specialize in artificial intelligence, life sciences, and robotics projects, overall employment growth in other sectors remains poor and Pittsburgh’s tech scene is still growing off a low base. Much of the development and transactions in the apartment sector occur in the CBD and Oakland / East End submarkets. Here, investors find the highest rent growth potential while still yielding attractive going-in cap rates. These submarkets are changing from aging industrial buildings to new office and apartment developments. The $273M “3 Crossings” master plan is set to build 2 apartment buildings with ~300 units by ‘21, among other developments. Despite these emerging positive trends, caution should be exhibited as the metro battles high millennial out-migration rates as graduates from the metro’s elite university systems look toward more desirable markets for employment. Additionally, rent growth is limited by the metro’s lack of supply constraints and inexpensive home prices, which drive high homeownership rates. Pittsburgh displays one of the highest economic cap rates in the nation, but worrying long-term growth prospects deserve a watchful eye.|Dense population in Pittsburgh / Oakland submarkets provides strong foot traffic|Influx of tech and pharmaceutical jobs could boost economy|Improving income growth and low cost of living leads to above-average consumer spending power|Below-average TAP scores demonstrate weak fundamentals in many submarkets|Minimal supply barriers hinder pricing power over the long term|Economic dependence on low-paying sectors 
11|207|Strip Center|Portland|Portland: Portland’s apartment fundamentals are driven by solid job and population growth among young adults looking for relative affordability and a high quality of life. The significant in-migration has resulted in robust rent growth over the last few years; however, developers have quickly caught on. Completions in ’19 reached an all-time high and while fewer new starts are now expected because of Covid-19, projects still in the pipeline will likely outpace demand in the coming years. Portland’s decision to enact statewide rent control has garnered national attention, and while the long-term impact of the new law remains unknown, it is expected to have a minimal effect on short-term apartment fundamentals since the 7+% inflation rent cap is far above rent growth projections. The concern lies within whether it will lead to tighter limits down the road that would negatively impact investors' ability to increase rents, hurting overall returns. A recently-passed measure that requires cities with >25,000 people to allow duplexes, triplexes, and quadplexes in areas zoned for single-family suggest already-low barriers to supply will ease further.	|Population gain and above-average income growth will continue to be a tailwind for retail consumption in the metro|Strong strip center demand from local restaurants, coffee shops, and microbreweries; part of Portland’s culture / draw|The CBD and Tigard submarket, which boast the highest TAP scores, should continue to see the highest rent growth|Increased support for tax increases, which could pressure business and personal income|Economic growth and the high-growth technology sector to lag larger West Coast markets|The Vancouver submarket, which resides in Washington and is subject to sales tax, often sees residents’ cross border to shop
11|209|Strip Center|Raleigh-Durham|Raleigh-Durham: Raleigh’s demographic profile has improved meaningfully after benefiting from exceptional employment growth over the last cycle and experiencing an influx of younger age cohorts. The recent demographic trends are expected to continue with near-term employment growth forecasted to be amongst the strongest of our top markets. Proximity to top universities, affordable living costs, and desirable submarkets are some of the key factors behind Raleigh’s strong population growth and domestic in-migration trends. As a result of strengthening demographics, M-RevPAF growth forecasts are expected to outperform most of our top markets. Raleigh’s booming apartment demand, however, has not been overlooked by local developers, and with low barriers to development, supply growth should continue to restrain rent growth over the next few years. One notable project contributing to the elevated supply pipeline in ’20 and ’21 includes Midtown Exchange, a $1B mixed-use project that will include ~1,300 new apartment units. Strong long-term growth forecasts offset low going-in yields following cap rate compression in recent years, resulting in solid return expectations. |Employment growth aided by life sciences / tech sector is expected to keep consumer strong|Retail spending to outperform national average by ~2x in ‘21, benefitting from a specialized labor force|Relatively strong occupancy levels supported by a lack of recent supply growth|Population density at the bottom of top markets, particularly within the Chapel Hill and Northeast Raleigh submarkets|High millennial population growth suggests higher ecommerce adoption|Public transportation currently not comparable to similar metros, hampering retail accessibility
11|210|Strip Center|Richmond|Richmond: A relatively affordable lifestyle and decent Fortune 500 presence drive apartment demand in Richmond, including headquarters for notable companies such as Altria and Carmax. The local economy relies heavily on business services and government jobs. Despite the region’s favorable cost of business, job growth has lagged behind the top market average consistently since mid-’16 (though the trend  somewhat reversed in 1H’20). The departure of Building Commissioner Douglas Murrow in ’18, whose stringent policies and slow-moving approval procedures were a source of headaches for local developers, has already increased the ease of real estate construction and led to a record-high development pipeline. Approval of ~$3M in tax breaks for Lynx Venture’s proposed 165-unit building in the Downtown / The Fan submarket is emblematic of the city’s new pro-development policies. Revitalization efforts in the Scott’s Addition neighborhood and the Downtown / The Fan submarkets has attracted an influx of millennials. An attractive going-in yield slightly offset by below-average long-term NOI growth expectations results in a solid return profile for apartment investors.|Pockets of affluence drive strong TAP Scores in Innsbrook, West End, and Glenside submarkets|Growing demand from grocers provides backfill option for big box vacancies|Diverse and resilient economy with a below-average unemployment rate|Below-average spending power per square foot|Mediocre job growth and income growth expectations |Below-average supply barriers and above-average supply growth expectations relative to the top markets
11|212|Strip Center|Sacramento|Sacramento: Fundamentals in Sacramento appear to be holding up nicely, with near-term M-RevPAF growth forecasted to outpace most top markets. As the Golden State capital, Sacramento benefits from strong and resilient employment in the public sector which has contributed to steady income growth over the last several years. The University submarket is likely to outperform others in Sacramento over the long term due to a denser population base and large presence of a younger renting cohort. As NIMBYism remains a significant impediment and lower rents make developments difficult to pencil, the supply pipeline is forecasted to remain relatively low. Though Sacramento struggles to compete with San Francisco and Silicon Valley for prominent tech interest, accelerating work from home trends could drive renter demand as employees are able to live further from their jobs and enjoy cheaper rents and  larger spaces. This trend has yet to fully play out and has room to run, thus long-term rent expectations in the market remain in line with the top markets. With high going-in yields relative to other California markets and healthy growth expectations, Sacramento boasts among the highest expected returns across the top markets. |Above-average retail sales growth forecasts over the near term|Folsom and Roseville submarkets benefit from affluent populations relative to other submarkets|Sprawling metro with relatively dense populations throughout the suburbs boosts demand across the market|A lack of growth in high-paying industries (i.e., TAMI) limits near-term income growth|Weaker demographics hinder long-term rent growth prospects relative to Bay Area peers|Low TAP scores in the Rancho Cordova submarket
11|213|Strip Center|Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City: Salt Lake City’s economy continues to diversify as companies from various sectors are drawn to the metro’s business-friendly environment and deep talent pool. A large portion of the market’s strong population growth is concentrated among younger age groups who are attracted to the lifestyle and job market, fueling demand for apartments in the CBD submarket due to the close proximity to many offices and the relatively urban, walkable location. Developers have responded to this demand with the construction of notable developments including The Block 67 project and The Exchange, which will add a combined ~1k units by ‘21. Many of these luxury apartments are highly amenitized developments targeting millennials and new residents, but ~80 apartments in The Exchange will be left for affordable housing. Developers will be able to keep the vast majority of units at market rates, though, as the Utah government did not pass a bill to give cities the choice to impose rent control in 1Q’20. The flood of supply in the market has dampened what would have been otherwise robust fundamentals the last three years, but favorable demand should be more than enough to absorb units that deliver over the next few years. Long-term NOI growth is aided by solid fiscal health and the metro’s relative desirability, and a high initial yield combined with a favorable growth outlook make for attractive potential long-term returns. |Income growth supported by high-paying diverse economy|Tourism spending drawn to Murray / Cottonwood and Sandy / Draper submarkets|Low cost of living and higher household income leads to good TAP scores for the market|High supply growth hurts an already over-retailed market|Local culture places a high value on frugality|Growing millennial population is more attracted to online shopping
11|214|Strip Center|San Antonio|San Antonio: Despite recent positive demand trends, the San Antonio apartment sector continues to face fundamental pressure stemming from the region’s housing affordability and lack of supply barriers. The metro has been a beneficiary of the fracking boom which has increased job and population growth, and it has also seen an increase in higher paying health care jobs; significant investment has been made to improve / expand health care facilities. Four large military bases provide stability and promote economic activity. Current rent and occupancy remain depressed from a large wave of new deliveries that hit the market in ’16 and ’17 during the energy recession, but stable demand supported by its exposure to the military has caused near-term M-RevPAF growth forecasts to be among the best of the top markets. Supply pipelines remain large in the near-term, while longer term, low barriers to entry, low levels of human capital, and large pockets of crime / poverty contribute to San Antonio’s mediocre long-term NOI growth prospects. The northern submarkets are better positioned than their southern counterparts, with the Northeast submarket standing out as a cut above the rest given its superior demographics. In aggregate, San Antonio screens middle-of-the-pack as compared with the rest of the top apartment markets regarding return expectations.|Higher population density drives high TAP scores in the Northwest submarket|Non-cyclical nature of economy provides stability|City offers cash incentives for small businesses|Majority of submarkets lack high disposable income|Limited supply barriers|Weak spending power per square foot driven by lack of skilled labor pool
11|215|Strip Center|Inland Empire|Inland Empire: With rental rates and home prices in Los Angeles and Orange County among the highest in the nation, many have turned to the neighboring Inland Empire as a cheaper housing alternative which has resulted in strengthening apartment fundamentals for the metro. The region’s position as a prominent west coast logistics hub has created thousands of new jobs—resulting in above-average population growth—and continues to drive decent housing demand. Chino and Corona, the closest submarkets to LA and OC, have seen the strongest renter demand due to above-average income levels and rising home prices. Given a severe housing shortage and overall lack of affordability, in 2H’19 AB 1482 was enacted by Governor Newsom implementing statewide rent control for renewal offers on apartments that are older than 15 years. The law will be in effect from January ’20 through January ‘30. Additionally, Prop 21, a measure to amend the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, will appear on the November ’20 ballot (a similar ballot measure failed in ’18), reigniting fear amongst landlords that local governments may be able to enact more restrictive forms of rent control. On the supply front, development has been dormant for much of this cycle, with most new deliveries being garden-style multifamily units. Single-family affordability and low-wage job growth relative to other Southern California metros will be among the largest long-term headwinds for apartment owners versus most West Coast markets.|Palm Springs submarket benefits from the concentration of resorts and year-round tourists|Pockets of affluence and higher levels of disposable income in the Southwest Riverside County submarket |Low-cost alternative to OC, LA and SD|Very low spending power PSF|Educational attainment levels lag the top market average |Job growth concentrated in lower paying and often temporary employment opportunities 
11|216|Strip Center|San Diego|San Diego: San Diego is consistently recognized as one of the most desirable places to live in the U.S. because of its pleasant climate, healthy demographics, and 70 miles of picturesque coastline. Fundamentals are supported by the strong university network that retains ~50% of students as full-time residents post-graduation, and home prices that remain unaffordable for recent graduates and most young families. The market is home to an array of headquarters including Sempra Energy and Qualcomm, along with a variety of employers that are drawn to San Diego’s talented workforce. New, highly amenitized supply growth is concentrated in the Downtown submarket, which has the lowest homeownership rate in San Diego at ~20%. San Diego has high supply constraints due to natural and legislative barriers. In Downtown San Diego, developers must comply with a 500-ft cap on buildings because of its close proximity to the airport. In 2H’19, AB 1482 was enacted by Governor Newsom implementing statewide rent control for renewal offers on apartments that are older than 15 years. The law will be in effect beginning January ’20 until January ‘30. Additionally, Prop 21, a measure to amend the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act will appear on the November ’20 ballot (a similar ballot measure failed in ’18), reigniting fear among landlords that local governments may be able to enact more restrictive forms of rent control. |High-paying industries lead to higher resident incomes|Affluent submarkets (La Jolla / North Beaches)|Strong natural supply barriers are furthered by high land costs|Slow total population growth forecasts through ‘25|Below average TAP scores in the El Cajon submarket largely due to lower education levels and household incomes|San Diego County carries an above-average sales tax relative to other top markets and rest of California
11|217|Strip Center|San Francisco|San Francisco: As a top tech hub with exceptionally high income levels, stable employment forecasts and one of the most educated population bases in the country, San Francisco remains among the most expensive places to rent. San Francisco continues to be one of the most difficult cities to build in, with NIMBYism, as well as geographic and regulatory barriers to development, impeding new supply. Political risk remains significant in the market as California, especially as leaders in Los Angeles and San Francisco, continue to tilt more populist and implement new legislation accordingly. Though Prop 10 (repeal of Costa-Hawkins Act, which limits the scope of rent control) lost in ‘18, the passage of AB 1482 in the state of California (limits annual rent increases to 5%),  took effect in early ’20. Similar campaigns are likely to pop up over the next several years with the most notable one being another potential repeal of Costa-Hawkins revisiting the ballot in November ‘20. Despite developing legislative headwinds, San Francisco’s long-term rent growth is likely to outperform most top markets largely as a result of the regulatory constraints and strong human capital. Further, homeownership in the Bay Area remains out of reach for many, especially in San Francisco, where the median home price reaches >$1M. It is worth noting that as work from home trends accelerate and companies (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) formulate plans for at least a portion of employees to permanently work remote, San Francisco’s high exposure to the tech industry may become a growing concern. Though going-in yields are low, elevated long-term NOI growth projections boost San Francisco toward the top of our return expectations across the  top markets. |High income boosts disposable income levels |Strong demographics drive high TAP Scores - indicative of a healthy strip center demand profile|Healthy retail sales growth expectations|Extremely high cost of living weighs on consumers' bottom line|Low cap rates weigh on return profile |Dense, affluent population primed for high ecommerce use
11|218|Strip Center|San Jose|San Jose: Big tech firms and their educated and well-compensated workforce drove much of the success in the South Bay market over the last cycle. In late ‘19, Facebook and Google announced plans to expand their presences by a combined ~8M SF in San Jose, creating space for an additional ~35k employees in the market. With multiple companies, including Facebook, expressing plans to shift a portion of employees to remote work solutions permanently, it remains unclear what portion of these jobs will be in the office full time as the secular shift to working from home continues to play out. In an attempt to improve the Bay Area housing crisis, Facebook, Google, and Apple have each pledged $1B to build additional housing and keep further home price appreciation at bay. Additional infrastructure projects include the ~$5.5B Silicon Valley BART expansion which will connect Oakland to San Jose and allow the workforce to travel between the metros more easily. Though affordable housing initiatives have become seemingly ubiquitous across California, favorable regulatory barriers remain in place, limiting future market rate supply growth. . While San Jose had been a relative winner of migration trends throughout much of the last cycle, near-term population growth forecasts appear to be in line with our top market average stemming from uncertainty related to the work from home shift. Though going-in yields remain low, and near-term growth prospects are stunted, strong long-term growth forecasts contribute to healthy return expectations.|Strong demographics contribute to healthy fundamentals |High-earning individuals bolster disposable income levels|Strong demographics drive high TAP Scores - indicative of a healthy strip center demand profile |High volatility increases downside risk|Low cap rates weigh on return expectations|Population growth expected to slow 
11|219|Strip Center|Seattle|Seattle: The prominence of giant tech firms, including Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, continue to drive high-paying job growth to the region. Apartment fundamentals have greatly benefited from the rapid expansion of these tech companies as they compete for top talent in the metro. Just within the past year, Apple, Amazon, and Expedia have added a combined ~6,000 jobs to Seattle, primarily concentrated in the South Lake Union and Bellevue submarkets. Institutional capital interest in the region has ramped— and with it came a wave of new development. The South Lake Union, Bellevue, and Central submarkets, Seattle’s most expensive areas, are seeing the highest new supply, likely causing rent growth to slow as developments are completed. In addition, legislation was passed in ‘19 that will lower barriers to supply in several submarkets. Microsoft announced plans to invest $500M to provide affordable housing in the Kirkland, Bellevue, and Federal Way submarkets. Individuals looking for rent relief from Seattle’s most expensive areas are fueling new demand and boosting fundamentals in the submarkets of Everett, Kent, and Federal Way. Despite weakening demand from the impacts of the pandemic, Seattle’s long-term growth and return expectations are among the best relative to other coastal markets.  |Significant in-migration; recognized as an attractive and desirable place to live|Strong personal income growth continues to bolster above-average retail sales growth|Amazon increasingly taking up space for food stores and larger “Amazon Go” formats|Uncertainty surrounding the metro’s economic health; could lead to higher taxes, reducing disposable income|Permanent closures of mom and pop restaurants / stores will weigh heavily on long-term growth potential|Large millennial presence may lead to increased online sales penetration, hurting brick and mortar
11|220|Strip Center|St. Louis|St. Louis: Fundamentals in St. Louis remain uninspiring as the market’s high exposure to low-growth sectors, such as manufacturing and trade, have rendered the local economy a laggard in terms of GDP and employment growth relative to other Midwest markets. While supply barriers remain low with few regulatory or geographic constraints, low growth and minimal demand have kept new development at bay. Given the market’s poor performance amidst a tepid supply pipeline, this trend is worrisome for local owners. Employment growth, which had been sluggish throughout most of the last cycle, will likely prove even more troublesome as employment trends are expected to slow amid the ongoing recession. A bright spot for the region has been Boeing and GM’s continued investment in the market; Boeing’s regional workforce has expanded by 2k jobs over the last couple years and GM recently invested $1.5B into their Wentzville truck factory. It remains to be seen how Boeing’s ongoing 737 troubles, further exacerbated by the current pandemic which has significantly reduced travel demand, will impact local hiring. Further headwinds for the St. Louis apartment market include an aging and stagnant population base as well as very affordable single-family homes. Relatively high going-in yields offset weak intermediate and long-term growth forecasts which results in a return profile that is expected to be in line with our top market average.|Local demographics skew older and may have lower propensity to shopping online|High TAP scores among REIT-owned properties aided by income levels in Clayton / Mid-County submarket|Few new development proposals have been made in recent years|Uninspiring job and population growth offer few opportunities for demographic improvement|Retail sales growth has lagged top markets by >75 bps annually since ’10 and is expected to trail average through ’25|Undesirable market overall; high crime and poor K-12 schools
11|225|Strip Center|Tampa-St. Petersburg|Tampa-St. Petersburg: Tampa’s strong population growth is largely driven by retirees, which tempers otherwise bright fundamentals. Law firm Baker McKenzie will open an innovation hub that will bring ~300 jobs to the Central Tampa submarket, and the health and life science research presence around the Moffitt Cancer Center continues to grow with Swedish biotech company Vycellix choosing Tampa for its U.S HQ. Supply growth in Tampa surpasses the top market average with new deliveries centered in the Central Tampa and Central St. Petersburg submarkets. In Central Tampa, investors should be wary of Midtown Tampa and Water Street, 2 mixed-use developments currently under construction that will bring ~1.7k units to the submarket. While traditionally a favorite for its healthy demographics, the Southwest Tampa submarket is also facing more supply. The Westshore Marina District has started construction and will add >1k apartments and condos, retail space, and a marina to the Southwest submarket. With an economy driven by local services and overall less sensitive to Covid-19 risk, Tampa is expected to perform well over the next 5 years, resulting in above-average M-RevPAF growth expectations. Over the long term, Tampa’s population growth and status as a desirable coastal market mitigate the effects of oversupply to support healthy long-term NOI growth for Tampa apartments.|Favorable population density in Pinellas county and Southwest Tampa will support sales productivity|Growing population has kept occupancy among highest of top markets|Outperforming labor market in ’20 aided by defensive job market composition supports consumers|Historic dependence on tourism spending places uncertainty in retail sector|Development in Midtown with ~1.8M SF of space expected in ’21, largely comprised of grocer / restaurant space|Poor Human Capital Score with household income distribution tilting toward lower earners
11|1264|Strip Center|Honolulu|Honolulu: As one of the world’s top tourist destinations, the Honolulu economy primarily relies on the leisure and hospitality sectors which have faced large recent headwinds due to Covid-19. The island’s isolated location and high-cost environment make it difficult for businesses to justify moving into the market, leading to limited employment growth in other sectors. The ever-rising cost of living has led to population declines in recent years, and much of the loss has been concentrated in the 34-and-below age group. Despite these negative tailwinds, limited supply insulates apartment fundamentals on the island. The strict entitlement and permitting processes, along with high land prices, make development time consuming and pricey. To make up for affordability issues on the island, the local government is working to ease supply barriers. Recent legislation (Bill 7) was approved in ‘19 in hopes of encouraging the development of more affordable housing for Honolulu residents. The new law allows higher density apartments to be built on lots of <20k SF in exchange for requirements to charge rates deemed affordable on at least 80% of the units. Douglas Emmett is also in the process of converting a ~490k SF office building into ~500 apartment units over the next few years in the Central Honolulu submarket. An unclear outlook for the Honolulu economy, out-migration, and easing supply barriers call for intermediate-term growth to remain among the lowest of the top markets, hindering the island’s risk-adjusted return expectations. |Ecommerce penetration is limited by 3-7 day shipping versus same day delivery on the mainland|The Central Honolulu and Waikiki submarkets are aided by high levels of population density|The retiree population should continue to grow at a steady clip over the next 5 years|Near-term retail sales are expected to lag the top markets due to the uncertain outlook for tourist spending|High cost of living weakens spending power for residents; cost of living continues to increase|The recovery of island retailers has lagged their mainland peers as tourist spending has yet to resume
11|1282|Strip Center|Columbus|Columbus: While the capital of Ohio is economically outperforming its Midwest peers, decelerating job growth in the FIRE and TAMI sectors coupled with a lack of supply barriers limit long-term prospects for Columbus. The city’s strengths lie in the large presence of Fortune 500 companies that have helped attract young talent and greatly contributed to the metro’s economic growth. Ohio State University, one of the largest universities in the U.S., also provides a strong base of educated professionals (~40% of graduates stay in Columbus). Developers have been actively adding new supply to the metro as strong in-migration and business expansions have increased apartment demand. Most of the new supply is concentrated in the University / Downtown submarket, where demand for mixed-use space has accelerated. If job growth continues to meaningfully decline in high-paying industries, the significant supply pipeline may dampen future apartment fundamentals, especially as the long-term effects of Covid-19 are felt. Investors should also be wary of affordable single-family housing placing a cap on rent growth. Overall, Columbus’ educated workforce and millennial population are helping apartment demand, but low barriers to entry limit long-term NOI growth and return expectations.	|Low unemployment and strong demographics in the Delaware County submarket lead to higher TAP Scores (>80)|Strong presence of government jobs provides economic stability |Stable fiscal health will aid the local economy |Low household incomes, particularly in the Downtown submarket, decrease discretionary spending |Weak pricing power is reflected in low historical rent growth |Below-average population density and median household income dampens the demand profile 
11|1316|Strip Center|Dallas / Fort Worth|Dallas / Fort Worth: The sprawling DFW metro has many strong demand drivers but is still susceptible to large waves of new supply. DFW continues to be an attractive business destination as employers are drawn to the region’s business-friendly environment, affordability, and centralized location, and the quality of job growth has improved in recent years with higher paying finance and tech job growth gaining momentum.  Low physical and regulatory barriers to entry have resulted in inflated supply pipelines and a deluge of new deliveries. These units are being matched with robust demand, resulting in average intermediate-term M-RevPAF growth forecasts. Long-term NOI growth is negatively impacted by the ease with which new supply can be added to the market. A significant portion of new supply is focused in the northern neighborhoods of Plano / Frisco and in the University Park submarket. Given current pricing and the healthy intermediate outlook, returns are expected to be around the top market average. |Northern submarkets possess higher household incomes and submarket grades (e.g., Frisco, McKinney / Allen)|Diversified economy provides stability|TAP scores for assets in the University Park submarket lead the metro area|The southern submarkets possess low TAP scores|Low supply barriers hinder rent growth by matching demand with fresh supply over the long-term|Income growth forecasts for the market remain muted
11|1521|Strip Center|D.C. Metro|D.C. Metro: D.C. Metro apartment fundamentals have lagged most major markets this cycle, though prospects are improving in the near term, the stability of public sector hiring should lead to a shallower trough in apartment rents and occupancy versus other coastal markets. Over the intermediate term, a highly-educated labor force and positive momentum on the TAMI job growth front bode well for apartment fundamentals. Amazon’s move to Crystal City will likely prove a win for local apartment owners as the firm will attract an influx of highly compensated employees. The new jobs associated with HQ2, which in total represent a 10% expansion of tech jobs for the market, are likely to be phased in over the course of ~10 years. Along with Crystal City, the Southwest Waterfront and Nationals Park neighborhoods continue to be hotbeds for new Class A product. Supply growth is expected to remain steady over the coming years, preventing a meaningful re-acceleration in rent growth (similar to most markets). As the pandemic exacerbates many large state and city deficits that will likely require significant tax hikes to resolve (e.g., NYC and NJ), D.C. stands to benefit as one of the few gateway markets not burdened by poor fiscal health. Uncertainty around government spending may continue to be a headwind for the area, but the D.C.
